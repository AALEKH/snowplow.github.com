			<p>As of this weekend, the SnowPlow repository on GitHub now has over 200 stars! We&#8217;re hugely excited to reach this milestone - this makes us:</p>

<ul>
<li>The 3rd most-watched analytics project on GitHub, after <a href='https://github.com/mnutt/hummingbird'>Hummingbird</a> (real-time analytics) and <a href='https://github.com/Countly/countly-server'>Countly</a> (mobile analytics)</li>

<li>The <a href='https://github.com/languages/Scala/most_watched?page=3'>58th most-watched</a> Scala project on GitHub</li>
</ul>

<p>Many thanks to everyone in the SnowPlow community and on GitHub for their support and interest!</p>

<p>We thought it might be interesting to share the <a href='http://jrvis.com/red-dwarf/?user=snowplow&amp;repo=snowplow'>Red Dwarf heatmap</a> of where our 202 GitHub stars are located across the world:</p>

<p><img alt='heatmap' src='/static/img/blog/2013/01/snowplow-stars-at-202.png' /></p>

<p>Beyond the &#8220;hot spots&#8221; in the US and Europe, it&#8217;s encouraging to see growing interest in SnowPlow from South America, South/East Asia and Australia/New Zealand. We look forward to checking back on the heatmap when we have some more stars!</p>

		<a name="Using OpenTag with SnowPlow" />
		<div class="post">
			18 Jan 2013
			<h1><a href="/blog/2013/01/18/using-snowplow-with-qubit-opentag">Implementing SnowPlow with QuBit's OpenTag</a></h1>
			<p>This is a short blog post to highlight a new section on the <a href='https://github.com/snowplow/snowplow/wiki/SnowPlow-setup-guide'>SnowPlow setup guide</a> covering <a href='https://github.com/snowplow/snowplow/wiki/Integrating%20Javascript%20tags%20with%20QuBit%20OpenTag'>how to integrate SnowPlow with QuBit&#8217;s OpenTag tag management system</a>.</p>

<p>In November last year, we started playing with tag management systems: testing SnowPlow with Google Tag Manager, and documented how to setup SnowPlow with GTM on the <a href='https://github.com/snowplow/snowplow/wiki/Integrating-javascript-tags-with-Google-Tag-Manager'>SnowPlow setup guide</a>. We were impressed on a number of fronts, but thought that the much more thought need to be put into what data was passed into the tag management system than people typically admit. (We documented our thoughts, at the time, on <a href='/blog/2012/11/16/integrating-snowplow-with-google-tag-manager/'>this blog post</a>.)</p>

<p>Since then, we&#8217;ve recommended that <strong>all</strong> new SnowPlow users setup a tag management system, prior to integrating SnowPlow on their website, if they have not already done so. The benefits of doing so are well documented elsewhere. For SnowPlow users, there are two big benefits in particular, that we will flag:</p>

<ol>
<li>Going through the exercise of implementing a tag management solution forces companies to take a rigorous look at the data they pass from their website into the tag manager, especially when declaring the data explicitly using things like the <code>dataLayer</code> (in GTM) or the <code>Universal Variable</code> in OpenTag. This makes it easier for analysts, down the line, to understand <em>what</em> data has been passed into their web analytics system, and how that data has been generated: key bits of information that can often get lost months after web analytics platforms like SnowPlow have been implemented. In addition, it makes the analytics as a whole more robust, as the generation of data is decoupled from the generation of other elements of web pages, which means web developers can continue to improve site functionality, safe in the knowledge they wont break anything on the analytics side.</li>

<li>A selfish reason, perhaps, but having our customers use a tag management platforms gives us the freedom to improve SnowPlow tracking tags where we see the opportunity, safe in the knowledge that we&#8217;re not causing our clients too much difficulty to upgrade their tags.</li>
</ol>

<p><img alt='qubit-opentag-logo' src='/static/img/blog/2013/01/qubit-opentag.png' /></p>

<p>We were eager, having integrated SnowPlow with GTM, to integrate it with an open source tag management system. After all, a big selling point of SnowPlow is that it is open source: enabling companies to setup, own and manage their own data infrastructure, without relying on a third party to mediate their access to their own data. We were therefore delighted that QuBit has developed an open source tag management system, <a href='http://www.opentag.qubitproducts.com/'>OpenTag</a>, and that we have finally documented <a href='https://github.com/snowplow/snowplow/wiki/Integrating%20Javascript%20tags%20with%20QuBit%20OpenTag'>how to integrate it with SnowPlow</a>.</p>

<p>There is a lot we like about QuBit&#8217;s OpenTag:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Open source</strong>. You can view the <a href='https://github.com/QubitProducts/OpenTag/blob/master/OpenTag.js'>OpenTag.js</a> on Github to get a handle on exactly how OpenTag works</li>

<li><strong>Low cost hosted service</strong>. QuBit offers free hosting for sites with less than 1M page views per month, and $99 per 10M page views thereafter</li>

<li><strong>Easy-to-implement host-yourself option</strong>. You can use OpenTag&#8217;s web UI to configure all your tags for free and publish the results to a Javascript file that you can then host on your own CDN (e.g. Amazon Cloudfront). By not using Qubit to host the configured javascript file with all your different tags, you are not locked into QuBit as a vendor. In addition, the cost of managing your tags across large sites, content networks and ad networks is kept at a bare minimum.</li>
</ol>

<p>In order to make it easier for new SnowPlow users to implement OpenTag alongside SnowPlow, and existing OpenTag users to implement SnowPlow, we&#8217;ve documented how to setup SnowPlow in OpenTag on our <a href='https://github.com/snowplow/snowplow/wiki/Integrating%20Javascript%20tags%20with%20QuBit%20OpenTag'>setup guide</a>.</p>

<p>Keep plowing!</p>

		<a name="Scala MaxMind GeoIP released" />
		<div class="post">
			16 Jan 2013
			<h1><a href="/blog/2013/01/16/scala-maxmind-geoip-released">Scala MaxMind GeoIP library released</a></h1>
			<p>A short blog post this, to announce the release of <a href='https://github.com/snowplow/scala-maxmind-geoip'><strong>Scala MaxMind GeoIP</strong></a>, our Scala wrapper for the MaxMind <a href='http://www.maxmind.com/download/geoip/api/java/'>Java Geo-IP</a> library.</p>

<p>We have extracted Scala MaxMind GeoIP from our current (ongoing) work porting our ETL process from Apache Hive to <a href='https://github.com/twitter/scalding'>Scalding</a>. We extracted this as a separate library for two main reasons:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Being good open-source citizens</strong> - as with our <a href='https://github.com/snowplow/referer-parser'>referer-parser</a> library, we believe this library willl be useful to the wider community of software developers, not just SnowPlow users</li>

<li><strong>Keeping SnowPlow&#8217;s footprint small</strong> - at SnowPlow we believe very strongly in building modular, loosely-coupled software. Massive monolithic systems that &#8216;do everything&#8217; are a nightmare to test, maintain and extend - so we prefer to build small, standalone components and libraries which we (and the community) can then compose into larger pipelines and processes</li>
</ol>

<p>On to the library: for Scala developers, the main benefits of using <a href='https://github.com/snowplow/scala-maxmind-geoip'>scala-maxmind-geoip</a> over the MaxMind Java library are:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Easier to setup/test</strong> - the SBT project definition automatically pulls down the latest MaxMind Java code and <code>GeoLiteCity.dat</code></li>

<li><strong>Better type safety</strong> - the MaxMind Java library is somewhat null-happy. This library uses Option boxing wherever possible</li>

<li><strong>Better performance</strong> - as well as or instead of using MaxMind&#8217;s own caching (<code>GEOIP_MEMORY_CACHE</code>), you can also configure an LRU (Least Recently Used) cache of variable size</li>
</ul>

<p>That&#8217;s it! And if you have any problems with this Scala library for MaxMind GeoIP lookups, please <a href='https://github.com/snowplow/snowplow/issues'>raise an issue</a> or get in touch with us via <a href='https://github.com/snowplow/snowplow/wiki/Talk-to-us'>the usual channels</a>.</p>

			<h1><a href="/blog/2013/01/09/from-etl-to-enrichment">The SnowPlow development roadmap for the ETL step - from ETL to enrichment</a></h1>
			<p>In this blog post, we outline our plans to develop the <a href='https://github.com/snowplow/snowplow/wiki/etl'>ETL</a> (&#8220;extract, transform and load&#8221;) part of the SnowPlow stack. Although in many respects the least sexy element of the stack, it is critical to SnowPlow, and we intend to re-architect the ETL step in quite significant ways. In this post, we discuss our plans and the rationale behind them, in the hope to get:</p>

<ol>
<li>Feedback from the community on them</li>

<li>Ideas for alternative approaches or new features</li>
</ol>

<p>We will cover:</p>

<li><a href='/blog/2013/01/09/from-etl-to-enrichment/#purpose'>Recap: the point of the ETL step</a></li>

<li><a href='/blog/2013/01/09/from-etl-to-enrichment/#limitations'>Limitations with the current, Hive-based ETL process</a></li>

<li><a href='/blog/2013/01/09/from-etl-to-enrichment/#enrichment'>From ETL to enrichment</a>: what we want the ETL step to achieve</li>

		<a name="Using ChartIO to visualise SnowPlow data" />
		<div class="post">
			08 Jan 2013
			<h1><a href="/blog/2013/01/08/using-chartio-to-visualise-and-interrogate-snowplow-data">Using ChartIO to visualise and interrogate SnowPlow data</a></h1>
			<p>In the last couple of weeks, we have been experimenting with <a href='http://chartio.com/'>ChartIO</a> - a hosted BI tool for visualising data and creating dashboards. So far, we are very impressed - ChartIO is an excellent analytics tool to use to interrogate and visualise SnowPlow data. Given the number of requests we get from SnowPlow users to recommend tools to assist with analytics on SnowPlow data, we thought it well worth sharing why ChartIO is so good, and give some examples of analyses on SnowPlow data using ChartIO.</p>

<p><img alt='chartio-pic-0' src='/static/img/blog/2013/01/chartio-0.png' /></p>

<p>In this post we cover:</p>

<ol>
<li><a href='/blog/2013/01/08/using-chartio-to-visualise-and-interrogate-snowplow-data#why'>Why is ChartIO so good?</a></li>

<li><a href='/blog/2013/01/08/using-chartio-to-visualise-and-interrogate-snowplow-data#setup'>Setting up ChartIO to work with SnowPlow</a></li>

<li><a href='/blog/2013/01/08/using-chartio-to-visualise-and-interrogate-snowplow-data#engagement'>Tutorial: using ChartIO to unpick the drivers of engagement with a site</a></li>
</ol>
<h2><a name='why'>Why is ChartIO so good?</a></h2>
<p>ChartIO is great for two reasons:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Fast</strong>. ChartIO is quick to setup. (Because it is a hosted product, with a very nice script for establishing an SSH connection between your database and the ChartIO web application.) At the same time, it is very quick, once a data connection is established, to create new graphs and charts and embed them in dashboards.</li>

<li><strong>Easy</strong>. ChartIO is easy to use. This is partly because the UI is really nice. (Lots of drag and drop, easy-to-follow workflow.) But it is also because ChartIO is very simple: it lacks a lot of the complexity of more traditional BI tools like Microstrategy and Pentaho. It is a lot simpler even than more recent innovations in the space like Tableau. Whilst this means it is a bit less powerful, the upside is the tool is a lot easier to use than comparable tools.</li>
</ol>

<p>ChartIO has one enormous advantage that makes it especially well suited to querying SnowPlow data: it does not require the data to be in a specific format before it will let users chart / graph it. That compares with the vast majority of tools (including Tableau, Qlikview, Pentaho and Microstrategy) that all require that any data is structured in a format suitable for <a href='/analytics/tools-and-techniques/converting-snowplow-data-into-a-format-suitable-for-olap.html'>OLAP analysis</a> before they can be used. (We covered how to convert SnowPlow data into that format in the <a href='/analytics/tools-and-techniques/converting-snowplow-data-into-a-format-suitable-for-olap.html'>analytics cookbook</a>.) ChartIO <strong>does</strong> work better with data that is formatted in this way, but it still works beautifully with the data as is. As a result, <strong>ChartIO is, we believe, the easiest way to build graphs and dashboards on top of SnowPlow data</strong>.</p>
