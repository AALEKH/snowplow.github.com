		<a name="New version of GA - what it means for SnowPlow adoption" />

			31 Oct 2012
			<h1><a href="/blog/2012/10/31/snowplow-in-a-universal-analytics-world-what-the-new-version-of-google-analytics-means-for-companies-adopting-snowplow">SnowPlow in a Universal Analytics world - what the new version of Google Analytics means for companies adopting SnowPlow</a></h1>
			<p>Earlier this week, Google announced a series of significant advances in Google Analytics at the GA Summit, that are collectively referred to as <a href='http://cutroni.com/blog/2012/10/29/universal-analytics-the-next-generation-of-google-analytics/'>Universal Analytics</a>. In this post, we look at:</p>

<ol>
<li><a href='#what'>The actual features Google has announced</a></li>

<li><a href='/blog/2012/10/31/snowplow-proposition-in-a-universal-analytics-world-what-the-new-version-of-ga-means-for-snowplow-adoption#whysnowplow'>How those advances change the case for companies considering adopting SnowPlow</a></li>
</ol>

<p><img alt='universal-analytics-image' src='/static/img/google-analytics-universal-analytics.png' /></p>
<a name='what' />
<h2 id='1_what_changes_has_google_announced'>1. What changes has Google announced?</h2>

<p>The most significant change Google has announced is the new <a href='https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/protocol/v1/'>Measurement Protocol</a>, which enables businesses using GA to capture much more data. This will make it possible for Google to deliver a much broader range of reports, of higher business value, than was previously possible. To understand the changes, we start by considering what <a href='#new-data-points'>new data points</a> businesses can <em>feed</em> GA, before considering <a href='/blog/2012/10/31/snowplow-proposition-in-a-universal-analytics-world-what-the-new-version-of-ga-means-for-snowplow-adoption#reporting-capabilities'>what that means for GA&#8217;s reporting capabilities</a>.</p>
<a name='new-data-points' />
<h3 id='11_custom_user_identifiers'>1.1 Custom user identifiers</h3>

<p>The first new data points that businesses can feed into Google Analytics is a user&#8217;s <code>client_id</code> (basically, a customer ID) as defined on the business&#8217;s own systems.</p>

<p>Previously, Google Analytics identified unique users using their own <code>cookie_id</code>s. Google&#8217;s <code>cookie_id</code>s are an excellent starting point for identifying users, because so many users have Google accounts (thanks to their myriad mass-market services, including Gmail, YouTube, Google Play etc): consumers using these services on multiple devices identify themselves to Google when they login, meaning that Google can marry their <code>cookie_id</code>s for these users on all the different devices they use. Our assumption is that Google already use this to reliably identify individual users across multiple platforms and devices.</p>

<p>For businesses using GA, being able to augment Google&#8217;s user identification with their own internal <code>client_id</code>s is a significant step forwards for two reasons:</p>

<ol>
<li>Many GA users (especially those with applications or properties where users login, or those with a loyalty card scheme) can identify their own users reliably on specific platforms, devices and physical stores. By adding this additional user identification data into GA, GA will be more accurate at identifying the same user in different places reliably, moving us further from a world in which we rely on persistent cookies dropped on browsers with unique identifiers, to one where users are more robustly identified via logins, payments and loyalty schemes. These approaches will still use cookies, but as part of a broader set of user identification business processes that actively involve the user in the identification process</li>

<li>It should make it easier for GA users to join GA data with other customer data sets on those <code>client_id</code>s. This is more of a nuanced point, as it was still possible previously to add customer IDs to GA as custom variables and use that to do joining</li>
</ol>

		<a name="SnowPlow 0.5.0 released with EmrEtlRunner" />
		<div class="post">
			25 Oct 2012
			<h1><a href="/blog/2012/10/25/snowplow-0.5.0-released">SnowPlow 0.5.0 released, now with a Ruby gem to run SnowPlow's ETL process on Amazon EMR</a></h1>
			<p>We have just released SnowPlow <strong>0.5.0</strong>, with an all-new component, the SnowPlow EmrEtlRunner. EmrEtlRunner is a Ruby application to run SnowPlow&#8217;s Hive-based ETL (extract, transform, load) process on <a href='http://aws.amazon.com/elasticmapreduce/'>Amazon Elastic MapReduce</a> with minimum fuss.</p>

<p>We are hugely grateful to community member <a href='https://github.com/mtibben'>Michael Tibben</a> from <a href='http://99designs.com'>99designs</a> for his contributions to EmrEtlRunner: thanks to Michael, EmrEtlRunner is more efficient, more flexible and more robust than it otherwise would have been - and ready sooner. Many thanks Michael!</p>

<h2 id='using_emretlrunner'>Using EmrEtlRunner</h2>

<p>EmrEtlRunner is a Ruby application which you can setup on your server to regularly take your raw SnowPlow logs (as stored in CloudFront access logs) and apply the Hive-based ETL process to them using <a href='http://aws.amazon.com/elasticmapreduce/'>Amazon Elastic MapReduce</a>. This ETL process populates a Hive-format events table which you can then use with the HiveQL recipes in our <a href='http://snowplowanalytics.com/analytics/index.html'>Analyst&#8217;s Cookbook</a>.</p>

<p>For detailed instructions on installing, running and scheduling EmrEtlRunner on your server, please see the <a href='https://github.com/snowplow/snowplow/wiki/Deploying-EmrEtlRunner'>Deploying EmrEtlRunner</a> guide on the SnowPlow Analytics wiki.</p>

		<a name="Analysing SnowPlow data with Tableau" />
		<div class="post">
			24 Oct 2012
			<h1><a href="/blog/2012/10/24/web-analytics-with-tableau-and-snowplow">Performing web analytics on SnowPlow data using Tableau - a video demo</a></h1>
			<p>People who see SnowPlow for the first time often ask us to <i>"show SnowPlow in action"</i>. It is one thing to tell someone that having access to their customer- and event-level data will open up whole new analysis possibilities, but it is another thing to demonstrate those possibilities.</p>

<p>Demonstrating SnowPlow is tricky because currently, SnowPlow only gives you access to data: we have no snazzy front-end UI to show off. The good news is that there are a lot of smart people developing fast, powerful and easy-to-use reporting tools. And because SnowPlow gives you access to underlying customer- and event-level data, it is easy to analyse SnowPlow data in nearly all of these tools. One such tool is <a href="http://www.tableausoftware.com/">Tableau</a> - we like Tableau as it is fast and intuitive, making it easy for us to perform train-of-thought analyses on SnowPlow data. (We will explain more on how to connect Tableau to SnowPlow data in a future blog post.)</p>

<p>In the following series of videos, we start to show how SnowPlow lets you use <a href="http://www.tableausoftware.com/">Tableau</a> for exploring your web analytics data. In the first video, we introduce Tableau and talk through the Tableau worksheet created with SnowPlow data for an online retailer:</p>

			21 Oct 2012
			<h1><a href="/blog/2012/10/21/infobright-ruby-loader-released">Infobright Ruby Loader Released</a></h1>
			<p>We&#8217;re pleased to start the week with the release of a new Ruby gem, our <a href='https://github.com/snowplow/infobright-ruby-loader'>Infobright Ruby Loader</a> (IRL).</p>

<p>At SnowPlow we&#8217;re committed to supporting multiple different storage and analytics options for SnowPlow events, alongside our current Hive-based approach. One of the alternative data stores we are working with is <a href='http://www.infobright.org/'>Infobright</a>, a columnar database which is available in open source and commercial versions.</p>

<p>For all but the largest SnowPlow users, columnar databases such as Infobright should be an attractive alternative to doing all of your analysis in Hive. The main advantages of columnar databases are as follows:</p>

<ol>
<li>Scale to terabytes (although not petabytes, unlike Hive)</li>

<li>Fixed cost (dedicated RAM-heavy analytics server), versus pay-as-you-go querying on Amazon EMR</li>

<li>Significantly faster query times – typically seconds, not minutes</li>

<li>Plug in to many analytics front ends e.g. Tableau, Qlikview, R</li>
</ol>

<p>So, open source columnar databases like Infobright Community Edition (ICE) are a good fit for SnowPlow analytics. Unfortunately, when we started to load SnowPlow event logs into ICE, we realised that there wasn&#8217;t a good data-loading solution for Infobright in Ruby, our ETL language of choice. So, we built one :-)</p>

<p>Our freshly minted <a href='https://github.com/snowplow/infobright-ruby-loader'>Infobright Ruby Loader</a> (IRL) can be used in two different ways:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>As a command-line tool</strong> - for manual loading of data into Infobright at the command-line. No Ruby expertise required</li>

<li><strong>As part of another application</strong> - because it&#8217;s a Ruby gem with a Ruby API, IRL can be integrated into larger Ruby ETL processes</li>
</ol>

<p>We will be using IRL at SnowPlow as part of our larger ETL process to load SnowPlow events into ICE for analysis - we hope to roll this out within the next few weeks.</p>

<p>In the meantime, we hope that IRL is useful to people in the Infobright community who need to run data loads at the command-line; IRL was inspired by <a href='http://www.infobright.org/Blog/Entry/unscripted/'>ParaFlex</a>, an excellent Bash script from the Infobright team to perform parallel loading of Infobright, and can be used as a direct alternative to ParaFlex.</p>

<p>To find out more about our Infobright Ruby Loader, please check out the detailed <a href='https://github.com/snowplow/infobright-ruby-loader/blob/master/README.md'>README</a> in the GitHub repository. And please direct any questions through the <a href='https://github.com/snowplow/snowplow/wiki/Talk-to-us'>usual channels</a>!</p>
