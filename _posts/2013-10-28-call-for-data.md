This winter we're recruiting a couple of [interns] [winternship] to join the Snowplow team to work on discrete projects.

A number of the candidates we've interviewed have expressed an interest in working with us to develop new analytics approaches on Snowplow data. In particular, we've had a lot of interest in piloting machine learning approaches to:

* Segmenting audience by behaviour
* Testing and comparing different libraries for content / product recommendation (e.g. PredictionIO, Mahout, Weka)
* Developing and testing new approaches to attribution

We are very keen, however, that if any of the above are done as a project by one of our interns, then they should do it on a real data set, for a real client, to answer real business questions.

![call-for-data][call]

To that end, we'd like to make an offer to the Snowplow community: do you have a data set (and one or more business questions) that you think would benefit from anyone of the above approaches? Would you be willing to "share" your data? We will want to blog about the approach and the results with the wider community, so we recognize that this may rule out a number of Snowplow users. (We hope there are ways to do this without giving away any commercial secrets :-).) For companies that are willing to let us loose on their data, you will hopefully get a valuable job-lot of insight at no cost.

Interested? Email us at [data@snowplowanalytics.com] [data-email].
