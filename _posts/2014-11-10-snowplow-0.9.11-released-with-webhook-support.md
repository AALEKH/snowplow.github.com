We are pleased to announce the immediate availability of Snowplow 0.9.11. For the first time, you can now use Snowplow to collect, store and analyze event streams generated by supported third-party software. Many Software-as-a-Service vendors publish their own internal event streams for customers to consume - these event stream APIs are often referred to as ["webhooks"] [webhooks-defn], sometimes as "streaming APIs", "postbacks" or "HTTP response APIs". Snowplow 0.9.11 adds first-class support for an initial set of these third-party webhooks.

This release is the first step in making our [Snowplow trackers] [snowplow-trackers] just one set of possible event inputs into your Snowplow unified log:

<<ADD IMAGE>>

For our initial 0.9.11 release we are adding support for three different webhook sources:

* [**MailChimp**] [mailchimp-website] - for tracking email and email-related events delivered by [MailChimp] [mailchimp-website]
* [**CallRail**] [callrail-website] - for tracking completed telephone calls logged by [CallRail] [callrail-website]
* [**Iglu**] [iglu] - for tracking [Iglu] [iglu]-compatible self-describing events, enabling you to use schema-less webhook APIs such as [**AD-X Tracking**] [adx-tracking-website]

Here are the sections after the fold:

<h2><a name="roadmap-etc">7. Roadmap and contributing</a></h2>

We are already working on the next set of webhook adapters for Snowplow - you can follow our progress in the [Webhooks 2] [webhooks-2] milestone in GitHub. The webhooks we will be supporting next will likely be:

1. [Mandrill] [mandrill-website]
2. [PagerDuty] [pagerduty-website]
3. [Pingdom] [pingdom-website]

We welcome any contributions of webhook adapters for other services - for details on getting started, please see [How to integrate a webhook into Snowplow] [webhook-contributing]. Please note that contributing will require some experience in Scala at this time.

Similarly, if you would like to sponsor the Snowplow team to build a webhook adapter, please [get in touch] [sponsorship-contact]!

<h2><a name="help">8. Documentation and help</a></h2>

Documentation relating to the new webhook support is available on the wiki:
