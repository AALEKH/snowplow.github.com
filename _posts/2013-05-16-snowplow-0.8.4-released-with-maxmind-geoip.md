We're pleased to announce the immediate availability of Snowplow **0.8.4**. This is a big release for us, as it adds geo-IP lookups to the Snowplow Enrichment stage, using the excellent [GeoLite City database] [geolite] from [Maxmind, Inc] [maxmind]. This has been one of the most requested features from the Snowplow community, we are delighted to add it to our Scalding ETL:

As well as geo-IP lookups, there are a number of other code improvements to the Scalding ETL, plus some minor improvements to EmrEtlRunner and some updates to the Redshift table; we will go through these below the fold.

In this post we will cover:

<h2><a name="geoip">1. The new geo-IP capabilities</a></h2>

The Snowplow Enrichment phase now looks up every IP address against MaxMind's [GeoLite City database] [geolite] in order to determine (where possible):

* `geo_country` - the two-letter [ISO 3166-1 alpha-2] [3166-1] country code associated with the IP address
* `geo_region` -  the two letter [ISO-3166-2] [3166-2] or [FIPS 10-4] [fips] code for the state/region associated with the IP address
* `geo_city` - the city or town name associated with the IP address
* `geo_zipcode` - the zip or postal code associated with the IP address
* `geo_latitude` - the latitude associated with the IP address
* `geo_latitude` - the latitude associated with the IP address

For further technical details it is worth going to the source and reading the [GeoIP CSV Databases technical reference] [geoip-data-ref] on the MaxMind website.
