We are proud to release the [Snowplow Android Tracker][repo]; one of the most requested Trackers so far. This is a major milestone for us, since it makes use of the latest [Snowplow 0.9.7][snplow-tag] release, made specfically for mobile tracking. 

The Android Tracker has been going through a lot preparation as we matured the Java Tracker. We've now based the Android Tracker on the same Java Tracker Core that runs the Java Tracker with a few additions, like tracking geographical location and mobile-specific context data. As such, you'll see many similarities between the two Trackers, which I'll explain in further detail in the rest of the post:
