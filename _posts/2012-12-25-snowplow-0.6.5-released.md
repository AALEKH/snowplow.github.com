We're excited to announce our next SnowPlow release - version **0.6.5**, a Boxing Day release for SnowPlow!

This is a big release for us, as it introduces the idea of **event types** - every event sent by the JavaScript tracker to the collector now has an `event` field which specifies what type of event it is. This should be really helpful for a couple of things:

1. It should make querying SnowPlow events much easier
2. It should make SnowPlow event data a better fit for JSON-oriented datastores such as MongoDB and Riak

As well as event types, in this release we also introduce the idea of **event IDs**. With this, the ETL phase adds an `event_id` UUID (universally unique ID) to each event row, which should really help with subsequent querying.

Here is a taster of how SnowPlow event data looks with the new event types and event IDs:

These are not the only improvements in this version - here are the rest:

* We have cleaned up the code for on-page activity tracking ("page pings")
* We have fixed a bug in our code for tracking ad impressions - thanks [Alan Z] [talkspoon]!
* The ETL no longer dies if a raw events has a corrupted querystring (e.g. the `refr=` parameter was not escaped)
* The JavaScript tracker's build script, `snowpak.sh`, now has a combine-only option (no minification), which is helpful for testing purposes
* The JavaScript tracker has a new method, `attachUserId(boolean)`, which can be used to stop the tracker sending a `uid=xxx` parameter (useful for the new Clojure Collector, coming soon)
* We have added the ability to override the IP address by passing in an `ip=` parameter on the querystring

Let's take a brief tour through these updates below:

## 2. Event IDs

This is much more unique than the existing `txn_id` field, which is a short random number set in the JavaScript tracker (eventually we will be using `txn_id` to check for duplicate )

## 3. On-page activity tracking

To come

## 4. Ad impression tracking bug fix
