We are very proud to announce the release of our new [Scala Forex library] [scala-forex], wholly developed by Snowplow wintern Jiawen Zhou. Jiawen joined us in the Snowplow offices in London this winter and was tasked with taking Scala Forex from a speculative README to an enterprise-strength Scala library for foreign exchange operations. One month later and we are hugely excited to be sharing her work with the community!

Scala Forex is a high-performance library for performing exchange rate lookups and currency conversions, built on top of the excellent [Open Exchange Rates web API] [ore-signup]. We are excited to be working with Open Exchange Rates, now Snowplow's second external data provider after [MaxMind] [maxmind]. Scala Forex makes heavy use of the Joda-Money and Joda-Time


 This release makes it easy for Snowplow users to get started analyzing their Snowplow data with [Looker] [looker], by providing an initial Snowplow data model for Looker so that a whole host of standard dimensions, metrics, entities and events are recognized in the Looker query interface.
