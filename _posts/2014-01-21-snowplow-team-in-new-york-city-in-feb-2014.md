Both Yali and myself will be visiting New York this February. If you're interested in meeting to discuss Snowplow, event analytics or big data processing more generally, we'd love to setup a meeting.

Yali will be in New York between February 9th and 12th (including attending the [Looker user group NYC meetup] [look-and-tell-meetup] on February 11th).

I'll be visiting later on in the month, between XXX and XXX. I'm particularly looking forward to attending the XXX meetup on Feb XXX. 

Reach out to us at yali at snowplowanalytics dot com or alex at snowplowanalytics dot com to setup a meet, suggest an event we should attend or for any other anything else you think we should know!
