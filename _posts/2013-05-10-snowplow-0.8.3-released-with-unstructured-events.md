We're pleased to announce the release of Snowplow **0.8.3**. This release updates our JavaScript Tracker to version 0.11.2, adding the ability to send custom unstructured events to a Snowplow collector with `trackUnstructEvent()`.

**Please note that this release only adds unstructured events to the JavaScript Tracker - adding unstructured events to our ETL process and storage targets is on the roadmap - but rest assured we are working on it!**

Many thanks to community members [Gabor Ratky] [xxx], [xxx] [xxx] and [xxx] [xxx], all from [XXX] [xxx], for contributing this great feature: Gabor and his team took JavaScript unstructured events from an item on our roadmap to a code-complete feature, big thanks guys! (And if you are interested in how the design and implementation of this powerful feature evolved, do have a read of the [original GitHub pull request] [xxx].)

<h2><a name="definition">1. What are unstructured events?</a></h2>

[Custom unstructured events] [unstruct-events] are user events which do not fit one of the existing Snowplow event types (page views, ecommerce transactions etc), and do not fit easily into our existing [custom structured event] [struct-events] format. A custom unstructured event consists of two elements:

* A name, e.g. "Game saved" or "returned-order"
* A set of name: value properties (also known as a hash, associative array or dictionary)

You might recognise what we call custom unstructured events from other analytics tools including MixPanel, KISSmetrics and Keen.io, where they are the primary trackable event type.

Custom unstructured events are great for a couple of use cases:

1. Where you want to track event types which are proprietary/specific to your business (i.e. not already part of Snowplow)
2. Where you want to track events which have unpredictable or frequently changing properties

<h2><a name="usage">2. Usage</a></h2>

Tracking an unstructured event with the JavaScript Tracker is very straightforward - use the `trackUnstructEvent(name, properties)` function.

Here is an example taken from our codebase:

{% highlight javascript %}
_snaq.push(['trackUnstructEvent', 'Viewed Product',
                {
                    product_id: 'ASO01043',
                    category: 'Dresses',
                    brand: 'ACME',
                    returning: true,
                    price: 49.95,
                    sizes: ['xs', 's', 'l', 'xl', 'xxl'],
                    available_since$dt: new Date(2013,3,7)
                }
            ]);
{% endhighlight %}

We have written a follow-up blog post to provide more information on using the new `trackUnstructEvent` functionality - please check this out for more information.

Some important notes about the properties:

1. JavaScript strings, numbers, booleans, null, Dates and arrays are all supported as property values
2. Arrays can be arrays of JavaScript strings, numbers, booleans or Dates (i.e. homogeneous arrays) 
3. Properties cannot be nested - so e.g. `category: { primary: 'Womenswear', secondary: 'Dresses'}` is **not** allowed

Did you notice the `$dt` syntax on the end of `available_since`? This is part of our syntax for handling date properties - we have three optional type suffixes for Dates:

* `$dt` - send this Date or number as the count of days since the epoch
* `$tm` - send this Date or number as the count of seconds since the epoch
* `$tms` - send this Date or number as the count of milliseconds since the epoch

You can pass in a Date object without a type suffix - in which case the `$tms` type suffix is automatically added, and the Date is sent to Snowplow as the count of milliseconds since the epoch.

This sounds complicated, but it's actually pretty straightforward. Here are some different options for sending in some obvious date types:

| In your `trackUnstructEvent` properties | What is sent to Snowplow | How Snowplow interprets it         |
|:----------------------------------------|:-------------------------|:-----------------------------------|
| `birthday: XXX`                         | `birthday: XXX`          | As a number                        | 
| `birthday: 
| `birthday$dt: XXX`                      | `birthday$dt: XXX`       | As a datetime, accurate to the day |
| `birthday$dt: new Date(2013,3,7)`       | `birthday$dt: XXX`       | As a datetime, accurate to the day |
