Following a lot of invaluable feedback from users setting up SnowPlow for the first time, we've updated the SnowPlow setup documentation.

The documentation can be found [here] [https://github.com/snowplow/snowplow/wiki/SnowPlow-setup-guide]. Any further feedback would be much appreciated - we want to make it as painless as possible for SnowPlow newbies to get up and running...
