We're very pleased to start the week by releasing a new version of SnowPlow - version **0.6.0**. This is a big release for us - as it includes the first version of our all-new StorageLoader. The release also includes a small set of tweaks and bug fixes across the existing SnowPlow components, but let's start by introducing StorageLoader:

## Introducing StorageLoader

StorageLoader is a Ruby application to download your SnowPlow event files from Amazon S3 and load them into databases for querying and analysis. We are launching StorageLoader with support for one database: [Infobright Community Edition] [ice], a high-performance columnar database based on MySQL.

The idea is that you configure StorageLoader with the details of the Infobright table to insert your SnowPlow events into, and then you schedule StorageLoader (e.g. in a cronjob) to regularly download your SnowPlow events and load them into Infobright. StorageLoader can run as soon as EmrEtlRunner has completed its job (and we include a script to run both in one go).

<!--more-->

With this setup, you will have your SnowPlow events easily accessible and queryable in a local Infobright instance - but you will can still fall back to querying the data in Hive if you wish.

The following resources should be helpful in terms of setting up StorageLoader:

* [StorageLoader setup guide] [storage-loader-setup] - taking you through installing and configuring StorageLoader
* [Infobright storage setup guide] [infobright-storage-setup] - explaining how to setup ICE and create the events table
* [Choosing a storage module] [storage-module-selection] - introduces the options and compares the merits of Infobright and Hive

## Other fixes in 0.6.0

We have made a number of other fixes across SnowPlow to prepare the ground for StorageLoader:

**EmrEtlRunner** has been bumped to 0.0.5, including upgrading it to Sluice 0.0.4 (which has some bug fixes around S3 path handling).

The **Hive deserializer** has been bumped to 0.5.1, and now outputs booleans such as `br_cookies` as 0 or 1 (instead of true or false) for the non-Hive output.

The **non-Hive format HiveQL script** has been bumped to 0.0.2 and now uses the new 0 or 1 approach to booleans. This is necessary so that true/false values can be successfully loaded into Infobright.

The **setup_infobright.sql** script has been bumped to 0.0.2 - we have changed the columns defined as booleans to be tinyint(1)s. This is just a formality, because Infobright creates 'boolean' columns as tinyint(1)s anyway.

## Roadmap

We are hugely excited about extending StorageLoader to support loading into other database and big data stores, including:

* [PostgreSQL] [postgres] - for companies without enormous volumes
* [Google Big Query] [google-big-query] - for fast analysis of massive data sets
* [SkyDB] [sky-db] - for event path analysis
* [MySQL] [mysql] - for companies without enormous volumes

We will keep you posted as we roll out support for additional database options in StorageLoader!
