We're excited to announce the release of SnowPlow version **0.7.2**. As well as a couple of bug fixes, this release includes our second SnowPlow tracker - the [No-JS Tracker] [no-js-tracker], to be used in web environments where a JavaScript-based tracker is not an option.

One of the bug fixes is particularly important: we are recommending that **all users of the Clojure-based Collector upgrade** to the new version (0.2.0) due to a serious bug in the way that event timestamps were recorded.

But first let's look at the No-JS Tracker, and then talk about the other fixes:

## Important bug fixes

We have fixed an important issue with the logging on the Clojure Collector ([issue 146] [issue-146]). The previous version was logging all event dates using a 12-hour clock - meaning that it was impossible to tell if an event happened in the morning or evening.

As a result of this, we **strongly recommend** that **all** users of the Clojure-based Collector upgrade to the new version, 0.2.0. As always, you can find this version available from our [Hosted assets page] [hosted-assets].

Our second bug ([issue 147] [issue-147]) was spotted and fixed by [Angus Mark] [angus-mark] from [Simply Business] [simply-business] - many thanks Angus! There was a bug in the JavaScript tracker where the secure flag was not being correctly set on SnowPlow cookies transmitted over HTTPS.

We don't believe that this bug was breaking any functionality, but you can upgrade to the new version 0.9.1 of the tracker at this URL:

And that's it! As always, if you do run into any issues, please [raise an issue] [issues] or get in touch with us via [the usual channels] [talk-to-us].
