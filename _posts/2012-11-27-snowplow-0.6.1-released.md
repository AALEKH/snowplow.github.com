We're happy to announce our next SnowPlow release - version **0.6.1**. This is a release with lots of small improvements and bug fixes, plus some neat new features (especially in terms of new data being tracked). We'll start by going through the updates to the JavaScript tracker, because most of the changes in the rest of the system flow through from those tracker improvements.

Before we start - a big thanks to the community members who helped out on this release in a big way:

* [Simon Andersson] [ramn] @ [Qwaya] [qwaya] substantially re-factored the JavaScript tracker, splitting it into multiple smaller files, which made our work much easier :-)
* [Gilles Moncaubeig] [moncaubeig] @ [Overblog] [overblog] contributed the user fingerprinting code - thanks Gilles!
* [Michael Tibben] [mtibben] @ [99designs] [99designs] continued his great work on EmrEtlRunner with improved command line options

## JavaScript tracker updates

We have released a new version of the JavaScript tracker, **0.8.0**. As always, we are hosting this new version on CloudFront if you don't want to host it yourself:

    http(s)://d1fc8wv8zag5ca.cloudfront.net/0.8.0/sp.js

But before you update your tags, we need to share a few important things about this new version, including a **breaking change**:

### Changes to the JavaScript API

Three main changes have been made to the JavaScript tracker's API - please note that the first is a **breaking change**, while the other two deprecate some existing functions (and introduce new ones):

1. **GETs `i` not `ice.png` (BREAKING CHANGE)** - version 0.8.0 of the JavaScript tracker now GETs a transparent 1x1 GIF called `i`, no longer `ice.png`. If you are using the CloudFront Collector, you **must** upload our [`i`] [i-pixel] pixel to sit in your S3 bucket alongside `ice.png`. Don't forget to make it publically readable
2. The `setAccount()` function was badly named. We have added a new function, `setCollectorCf()`, which does the exact same thing, and we'll remove `setAccount()` in a future version. If you continue to use `setAccount()`, then a warning message will be printed to `console.log` (it will still work though)
3. The `getTracker()` function (which not many people need to use) was pretty confusingly named. As wth point 2 above: we have added `getTrackerCf()` and `getTrackerUrl()`, and deprecated `getTracker()` for now

As always, our JavaScript tracker's current API is fully documented on our Wiki, on the [JavaScript Tracker] [javascript-tracker] page.

### New tracking data

Version 0.8.0 of the JavaScript tracker now passes some additional data along to the SnowPlow collector. This additional data is as follows:

* **Tracker version** - this means you will always know which version of the JavaScript tracker generated a given SnowPlow event
* **User fingerprint** - we are still working on a new collector which supports cross-domain user tracking. In the meantime, we are releasing an experimental feature: a 'user fingerprint' based on various (hopefully unique) attributes of each user's browser. Many thanks to [Gilles] [moncaubeig] for contributing this feature; to read more about this, please take a look at [issue #70] [issue-70] in GitHub
* **Timezone** - what timezone is the user in? The tracker records the [Olsen key] [olsen-key] for the user's timezone
* **Color depth** - the bit depth of the browser's color palette for displaying images (in bits per pixel)

Please note that we have updated the ETL and storage systems (e.g. Hive and Infobright table definitions) to support these new fields.

As always, our approach to passing these new datapoints to a collector are fully documented on our Wiki, on the [SnowPlow Tracker Protocol] [tracker-protocol] page.

## ETL improvements

This release includes various improvements to SnowPlow ETL and storage which are unrelated to the JavaScript tracker changes above. To break these down:

### New felds

* **Useragent** - the raw useragent field is now logged. Previously we were throwing this away
* **Platform** - the overall platform which this tracker runs on is now extracted. Note that the JavaScript tracker always sets this field to `web`

### Bug fixes

Just one bug fix - in the StorageLoader, we changed the field encloser for Infobright to `NULL`, where previously it was `''` (two empty quotes). This was to fix [issue #88] [issue-88], where Infobright was throwing an error and dying if a field value started with a double-quote.

## Getting help

If you have any problems with version 0.6.1, please [raise an issue] [issues] or get in touch with us via [the usual channels] [talk-to-us].

And let us know if the new features - like user fingerprinting - are useful!
