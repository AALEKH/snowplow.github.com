We are pleased to announce the immediate availability of Snowplow **0.8.5**. This is a bug fixing release, following a week after our launch of Snowplow 0.8.4 with geo-IP lookups.

This release fixes one showstopper issue with Snowplow 0.8.4, and also includes a set of smaller enhancements to help the Scalding ETL better handle "bad quality" event data from webpages. We recommend everybody on the Snowplow 0.8.x series upgrade to this version.

Many thanks to community members [Peter van Wesep] [petervanwesep] and [Gabor Ratky] [rgabo] for their help identifying and debugging the issues fixed in this release!

In this post we will cover:

<h2><a name="showstopper">1. The showstopper bug fix</a></h2>



<h2><a name="other-improvements">2. Other improvements</a></h2>

<h2><a name="upgrading">3. Upgrading</a></h2>

There are **three components** to upgrade in this release:

* The Scalding ETL, to version 0.3.1
* EmrEtlRunner, to version 0.2.1
* The Redshift events table, to version 0.2.1

Alternatively, if you are still using Infobright with the legacy Hive ETL, you can upgrade your Infobright events table, to version 0.0.9.

Let's take these in turn:

### Hadoop ETL

If you are using EmrEtlRunner, you need to update your configuration file, `config.yml`, to the latest version of the Hadoop ETL:

	:snowplow:
	  :hadoop_etl_version: 0.3.1 # Version of the Hadoop ETL

### EmrEtlRunner

You need to upgrade your EmrEtlRunner installation to the latest code (0.8.5 release) on GitHub:

    $ git clone git://github.com/snowplow/snowplow.git
    $ git checkout 0.8.5

### Redshift events table

We have updated the Redshift table definition - you can find the latest version in the GitHub repository [here] [table-def-sql].

If you already have your Snowplow data in the previous version of the Redshift events table, we have written [a migration script] [migrate-sql] to handle the upgrade. **Please review this script carefully before running and check that you are happy with how it handles the upgrade.**

### Infobright events table

If you are storing your events in Infobright Community Edition, you can also update your table definition. To make this easier for you, we have created a script:

    4-storage/infobright-storage/migrate_008_to_009.sh

Running this script will create a new table, `events_009` (version 0.0.9 of the Infobright table definition) in your `snowplow` database, copying across all your data from your existing `events_008` table, which will not be modified in any way.

Once you have run this, don't forget to update your StorageLoader's `config.yml` to load into the new `events_009` table, not your old `events_008` table:

    :storage:
      :type: infobright
      :database: snowplow
      :table:    events_009 # NOT "events_008" any more

Done!
