Today we are releasing SnowPlow version **0.6.3** - another clean-up release following on from the 0.6.2 release. This release bumps the JavaScript Tracker to version 0.8.2, and the Hive-data-format HiveQL file to version 0.5.2.

Many thanks to community members who contributed bug fixes to this release: [Mike Moulton] [mmoulton] @ [meltmedia] [meltmedia], [Simon Andersson] [ramn] @ [Qwaya] [qwaya] and [Michael Tibben] [mtibben] @ [99designs] [99designs].

We'll take a look at both fixes below:

## JavaScript Tracker fixes

This release fixes the issues in the JavaScript tracker raised in [issue 103] [issue-103].

These issues stemmed from the splitting of the JavaScript into multiple files in SnowPlow version 0.6.1 (JavaScript Tracker version 0.8.0). We do not believe these bugs affected SnowPlow data collection, but they are well worth fixing.

Many thanks to [Simon Andersson] [ramn] and [Simon Andersson] [ramn] for their help in squashing these bugs!

With these fixes we have bumped the JavaScript Tracker to version 0.8.2; the updated minified tracker is available as always here:

## HiveQL script fix

This release also fixes a bug in the HiveQL file used to generate the **Hive-format** SnowPlow event files. See [issue 112] [issue-112] for details on this.

This bug prevented the ETL from running if you were using EmrEtlRunner to generate Hive-format SnowPlow event files, i.e. if you had:

    :storage_format: non-hive

set in your EmrEtlRunner's `config.yml` file.

Many thanks to [Mike Moulton] [mmoulton] for spotting and fixing this one!

This fix bumps the Hive-format HiveQL file to version 0.5.2. To start using the new file, all you need to do is update your EmrEtlRunner's `config.yml` file by changing:

    :hive_hiveql_version: 0.5.1

to:

    :hive_hiveql_version: 0.5.2
