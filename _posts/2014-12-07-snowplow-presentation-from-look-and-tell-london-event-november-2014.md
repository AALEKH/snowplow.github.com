Last month the Looker team flew into London for their inaugural [Look&Tell London][looker-london]. I was very lucky to be given the opportunity to speak at the event.

In my presentation I walked through, at a high-level, how Snowplow works with Looker, and the critical data modelling steps that occur in LookML, in particular. My slides are below:

I look forward to the next [Looker][looker] event in London!
