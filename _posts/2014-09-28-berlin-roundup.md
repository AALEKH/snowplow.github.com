Yali and I are back from the Snowplow team's [trip to Berlin] [berlin-trip] - it was a great visit, seeing plenty of new and old faces alike.

We started Wednesday with a Snowplow technology roundtable with some of Berlin's large consumer startups, huge thanks to [Onefootball] [onefootball]'s Onur Akpolat for organizing!

In the evening it was time for [Big Data Beers] [bigdatabeers], hosted by German e-commerce giant [Zalando] [zalando] in their offices with views over Alexanderplatz.

The talk also prompted something of a debate about the

This was my first trip to Berlin for Snowplow (Yali's second), and I was really impressed by how dynamic and technical the startup scene is there. I look forward to my next trip!

Yali will be back in Berlin on XXX for the XXX - we will provide more details nearer the time.
