Yali and I are back from the Snowplow team's [trip to Berlin] [berlin-trip] - it was a great visit, seeing plenty of new and old faces alike.

<h2><a name="install">1. Wednesday: startups roundtable and DAALA</a></h2>

We started Wednesday with a Snowplow technology roundtable with some of Berlin's large consumer startups, huge thanks to [Onefootball] [onefootball]'s Onur Akpolat for organizing! All of the companies attending were very active in mobile, so it was great to be able to talk about Snowplow's [new support for mobile analytics] [mobile-analytics] in some detail.

In the evening was a Snowplow-flavored [DAALA Berlin event] [daala] at Volksbar in Mitte; DAALA is a monthly digital analytics event organised by [Matthias Bettag] [matthias]. Yali gave an overview of the Snowplow platform, followed by [Christian Lubasch] [christian] from Snowplow partner [LeROI Marketing] [leroi], who shared his insights into implementing and using Snowplow at GoEuro, a multi-mode travel business.

<h2><a name="install">2. Thursday: co-up and Big Data Beers</a></h2>

On Thursday we de-camped to [co-up] [co-up], our new co-working space in Kreuzburg. Huge thanks to co-up for hosting us on Thursday (and me again on Friday) - it's a very programmer-friendly collective

In the evening it was time for [Big Data Beers] [bigdatabeers], hosted by German e-commerce giant Zalando in their offices with views over Alexanderplatz. I was speaking alongside [Roland Vollgraf] [roland], a Data Scientist from Zalando, who gave an excellent talk on how Zalando uses machine learning to determine item weights based on parcel weights.
