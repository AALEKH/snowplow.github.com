Just nine days after our Snowplow 0.8.0 release, we are pleased to have our next release ready: Snowplow **0.8.1**. With the last release we promised that the new Scalding-based ETL/enrichment process would lay a strong technical foundation for our roadmap - and hopefully this release bears that out!

In this release, Snowplow now parses the page referer URIs which the JavaScript tracker sends to the collector. The Snowplow enrichment layer does a couple of things with these referer URIs:

1. It splits the referer URL into its six components (scheme, host, port, path, query, fragment)
2. It looks up the referer URL in a database of known referers and attempts to extract details about this referer, which you can then use for marketing attribution

In the rest of this post, then, we will cover:

<h2><a name="referer-parsing">1. Referer parsing implementation</a></h2>

The extraction of the referer URL into its six components should be relatively straightforward. The second stage, looking up the referer URL in a database of known referers, is worth discussing in a little more detail.

Our referer analysis process uses the latest version of our separate and standalone [referer-parser] [referer-parser] library. This library comes with a sizeable database of known referers, including search engines, social networks and webmail providers.

Snowplow feeds the referer URI and page URI to referer-parser to identify which `refr_medium` this referer URL belongs to:
1. "search" means that this referer is a known search engine
2. "social" means a social network or similar site
3. "email" means a webmail provider such as Yahoo! Mail
4. "internal" means that the referer was another page on the same domain
5. "unknown" means that there was a referer, but we couldn't identify it as belonging to one of the other categories

If the referer can be found in the referer-parser database, then we store the name of the refering site in the `refr_source` field.

Finally, if the referer is a "search" referer and we can pull out a search term from the referer URL, then we store this search term in the `refr_term` field.

<h2><a name="upgrading-usage">3. Upgrading and usage</a></h2>

As with the 0.8.0 release, this new release assumes that you are running the Hadoop (Scalding) ETL and feeding your data into Redshift.

To upgrade to 0.8.1 from 0.8.0, follow these steps:

### 4.1 ETL

If you are using EmrEtlRunner, you need to update your configuration file, `config.yml`, to the latest version of the Hadoop ETL:

	:snowplow:
	  :hadoop_etl_version: 0.2.0 # Version of the Hadoop ETL

### 4.2 Redshift

We have updated the Redshift table definition, you can find the latest version in the GitHub repository [here] [table-def-sql].

If you already have your Snowplow data in the previous version of the Redshift events table, then we have written [a migration script] [migrate-sql] to handle the upgrade. **Please review this script carefully before running and check that you are happy with how it handles the upgrade.**

Also please note that we have had to remove the "raw" `referrer_url` field from our Redshift events table for space reasons. This means that your historical data will lose **all** referer information in your events table unless you run a re-computation, see below.

### 4.3 (Optional) Re-computation

If you would like to see referer details for historic Snowplow events (i.e. events already in your Snowplow events table in Redshift), then we recommend re-running your Snowplow ETL process across all of your historical raw data.

This is also advisable given that we have removed the `referrer_url` field from our Redshift table definition for space reasons.

To re-run your Snowplow ETL process across all your historical data, please see our troubleshooting answer to [I want to recompute my SnowPlow events, how?] [recompute-wiki] on the wiki.

### 4.4 Usage

And that's it! Once you have made these changes, you should Snowplow populating the referer details for all new events.

<h2><a name="help">4. Getting help</a></h2>

As always, if you do run into any issues or don't understand any of the above changes, please [raise an issue] [issues] or get in touch with us via [the usual channels] [talk-to-us].
