We're excited to announce the release of SnowPlow version **0.7.3**. This release adds a set of **16 all-new fields** to our event model:

* A new `event_vendor` field
* The `page_url` split out into its component parts (scheme, host, port, path, querystring, fragment/anchor)
* The web page's characterset
* The web page's width and height
* The browser's viewport (i.e. visible width and height)
* For page pings, we are now tracking the user's scrolling during the last ping period (four fields)

This release necessarily involves updates to the JavaScript tracker, the Hive ETL process and the Infobright storage table.

As well as adding support for the new fields, this new version introduces some **breaking changes** and deprecations which should be handled carefully by existing installations. We will discuss these first, before detailing the new fields, then the bug fixes and finally the upgrade process.

## Breaking changes and deprecations

The following table tracks the breaking changes and deprecations in this version. **When upgrading to the latest version of the JavaScript tracker (0.10.0), please update your JavaScript tags as per the instructions below to avoid problems.**

| Type of change  | Component               | Change                         | Comment                          |
|:----------------|:------------------------|:-------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Breaking change | JavaScript tracker      | `getAccount()` removed         | Use instead |
| Breaking change | JavaScript tracker      | `getTracker()` removed         | Use instead |
| Breaking change | JavaScript tracker      | `setHeartBeatTimer()` removed  | Use `enableActivityTracking()` instead | 
| Deprecation     | JavaScript tracker      | `trackEvent()` deprecated      | Use `trackStructEvent()` instead       |
| Data change     | S3 & Infobright storage | `event`="custom" changed       | Changed to `event`="struct"            |

The first three changes are simply cleanup: we are removing tracker methods which we previously deprecated some time ago.

The last two changes are us starting to re-structure our event tracking - we are making space in our event model to support unstructured events, which will be coming soon. Please check out our previous blog post, [Help us build out the SnowPlow Event Model] [event-model-blog-post] for more background on this.

## New fields

We are hugely excited to be including 16 new fields in this release - we believe that these fields should unlock a whole host of new analyses on SnowPlow data.

For completeness, we list out all of the new fields below. Note that all of the new fields are available in both the S3 (aka Hive) and Infobright (aka non-Hive) storage outputs:

| Field              | Datatype | Description                                          |
|:-------------------|:---------|:-----------------------------------------------------|
| `event_vendor`     | string   | Which company or org. defined this event type        | 
| `page_urlscheme`   | string   | Scheme aka protocol, e.g. "https"                    |
| `page_urlhost`     | string   | Host aka domain, e.g. "www.snowplowanalytics.com"    |
| `page_urlport`     | int      | Port if specified, 80 if not                         |
| `page_urlpath`     | string   | Path to page, e.g. "/product/index.html"             |
| `page_urlquery`    | string   | Querystring, e.g. "id=GTM-DLRG"                      | 
| `page_urlfragment` | string   | Fragment aka anchor, e.g. "4-conclusion"             |
| `br_viewwidth`     | int      | The width of the browser's viewport in pixels        |
| `br_viewheight`    | int      | The height of the browser's viewport in pixels       |
| `doc_charset`      | string   | The page's character encoding, e.g. "UTF-8"          |
| `doc_width`        | int      | The total width of the page (incl. non-viewed area)  |
| `doc_height`       | int      | The total height of the page (incl. non-viewed area) |
| `pp_xoffset_min`   | int      | Minimum page x offset seen in the last ping period   |
| `pp_xoffset_max`   | int      | Maximum page x offset seen in the last ping period   |
| `pp_yoffset_min`   | int      | Minimum page y offset seen in the last ping period   |
| `pp_yoffset_max`   | int      | Maximum page y offset seen in the last ping period   |

Don't worry if some of these new fields don't make immediate sense based on the descriptions above - we will take a look at each of these fields in the sub-sections below:

### Event vendor

Going forwards, all events will have an `event_vendor` field - to start with, that vendor will be "com.snowplowanalytics" (using the Java package-style naming convention). Adding this field helps us to futureproof SnowPlow, so that we can eventually support:

1. Ingesting proprietary events from third-party systems (e.g. `event_vendor`="com.sendgrid" or "com.appnexus")
2. Ingesting clickstream events from other analytics services (e.g. `event_vendor`="com.adobe" or "com.mixpanel")
3. Tracking custom events defined by a specific SnowPlow user (e.g. `event_vendor`="au.com.asnowplowuser")

### Page URL components

As seen above, we are now splitting the `page_url` into its six component parts (the unprocessed `page_url` field is left unchanged). Having these fields broken out should make it much easier to do page URL-based analyses, such as querying by specific pages or investigating HTTPS traffic.

### Viewport fields

Each event now tracks the current viewport of the browser - in other words, the viewable area (width x height) current available within the browser.

### Document characterset 

Each event now tracks the document's charset where available (not all browsers set this).

### Document width and height

We are now tracking the complete width and height of the current document (aka web page) on each event. This tells you the total width and height of the current page, as perceived by the browser. This measures the whole document - i.e. the non-viewable part of the document, not just the part currently in the viewport.

### Page ping offsets

These offsets are perhaps the most complex 

As well as a couple of bug fixes, this release includes our second SnowPlow tracker - the [No-JS Tracker] [no-js-tracker], to be used in web environments where a JavaScript-based tracker is not an option.

One of the bug fixes is particularly important: we are recommending that **all users of the Clojure-based Collector upgrade** to the new version (0.2.0) due to a serious bug in the way that event timestamps were recorded.

But first let's look at the No-JS Tracker, and then talk about the other fixes:

## Introducing the No-JavaScript Tracker

The [No-JS Tracker] [no-js-tracker] (or 'pixel tracker') can be used to log web events in environments that do not support Javascript. Examples of events include:

* Views an HTML email
* Views of product listing on a 3rd party marketplace
* Views a page on a 3rd party hosting site

Our [No-JS Tracking tag wizard] [no-js-tracker] makes it easier to generate pure-HTML tracking tags. Were you to embed these in email marketing messages, for example, you would be able to compare the behaviour of users on your website who had opened specific messages with those who had not. The [No-JS Tracker] [no-js-tracker] enables you to track a broader set of user events in SnowPlow, so providing greater coverage of your users' journeys. For more information on the [No-JS tracker] [no-js-tracker] see the [blog post] [introducing-no-js-tracker].

## Important bug fixes

We have fixed an important issue with the logging on the Clojure Collector ([issue 146] [issue-146]). The previous version was logging all event dates using a 12-hour clock - meaning that it was impossible to tell if an event happened in the morning or evening.

As a result of this, we **strongly recommend** that **all** users of the Clojure-based Collector upgrade to the new version, 0.2.0. As always, you can find this version available from our [Hosted assets page] [hosted-assets].

Our second bug ([issue 147] [issue-147]) was spotted and fixed by [Angus Mark] [angus-mark] from [Simply Business] [simply-business] - many thanks Angus! There was a bug in the JavaScript tracker where the secure flag was not being correctly set on SnowPlow cookies transmitted over HTTPS.

We don't believe that this bug was breaking any functionality, but you can upgrade to the new version 0.9.1 of the tracker at this URL:

    http(s)://d1fc8wv8zag5ca.cloudfront.net/0.9.1/sp.js

And that's it! As always, if you do run into any issues, please [raise an issue] [issues] or get in touch with us via [the usual channels] [talk-to-us].
