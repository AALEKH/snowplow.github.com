We're excited to announce our next SnowPlow release - version **0.6.5**, a Boxing Day release for SnowPlow!

This is a big release for us, as it introduces the idea of **event types** - every event sent by the JavaScript tracker to the collector now has an `event` field which specifies what type of event it is. This should be really helpful for a couple of things:

1. It should make querying SnowPlow events much easier
2. It should make SnowPlow event data a better fit for JSON-oriented datastores such as MongoDB and Riak

As well as event types, in this release we also introduce the idea of **event IDs**. With this, the ETL phase adds an `event_id` UUID (universally unique ID) to each event row, which should really help with subsequent querying.

Here is a taster of how SnowPlow event data looks with the new event types and event IDs:

These are not the only improvements in this version - here are the rest:

* We have cleaned up the code for on-page activity tracking ("page pings")
* We have fixed a bug in our code for tracking ad impressions - thanks [Alan Z] [talkspoon]!
* The ETL no longer dies if a raw events has a corrupted querystring (e.g. the `refr=` parameter was not escaped)
* The JavaScript tracker's build script, `snowpak.sh`, now has a combine-only option (no minification), which is helpful for testing purposes
* The JavaScript tracker has a new method, `attachUserId(boolean)`, which can be used to stop the tracker sending a `uid=xxx` parameter
* We have added the ability to override the IP address by passing in an `ip=` parameter on the querystring

Let's take a brief tour through these updates below:

## 1. Event types

## 2. Event IDs

As stated above, the SnowPlow ETL now attaches a unique ID to each event - specifically a [type 4 UUID] [type4-uuid]. This new `event_id` is much more unique than the existing `txn_id` field, which is a short random number set in the JavaScript tracker (eventually we will start using `txn_id` to check for duplicate events).

## 3. On-page activity tracking

In this release of the JavaScript tracker we have deprecated the old (undocumented) `setHeartBeatTimer()` inherited from piwik.js, and introduced a new function:

    enableActivityTracking(minimumVisitLength, heartBeatDelay)

With activity tracking enabled, "page pings" are sent to SnowPlow every `heartBeatDelay` seconds, as long as the visitor remains active (moving the mouse, clicking etc) on the page. Page pings are not sent until the `minimumVisitLength` seconds have elapsed.

Here is an example:

[EXAMPLE HERE]

Please note that enabling activity tracking can significantly increase the number of SnowPlow events generated.

## 4. And the rest

The rest of the changes in this release are much smaller, either bug fixes or small preparatory features for future releases:

### Ad impression tracking bug fix

Many thanks to [Alan Z] [talkspoon] @ [VeryCD] [verycd] for spotting a bug in the `trackImpression()` method, which was stopping ad impressions from being logged. This is now fixed.

### ETL resilient against corrupted querystring

To come

### snowpak.sh combine-only option

### attachUserId(boolean)

The JavaScript tracker has a new method, `attachUserId(boolean)`, which can be used to stop the tracker sending a `uid=xxx` parameter. By default, the JavaScript tracker sends the user ID to the collector via this `uid` parameter; you disable this by calling `attachUserId()` like so:

[EXAMPLE HERE]

This will be part of the configuration for using the new Clojure Collector, which we are currently working on.

### IP address override

To come
