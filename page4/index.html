			<h1><a href="/blog/2013/02/08/writing-hive-udfs-and-serdes">Writing Hive UDFs - a tutorial</a></h1>
			<p><em>Snowplow&#8217;s own <a href='https://github.com/alexanderdean'>Alexander Dean</a> was recently asked to write an article for the <a href='http://sdjournal.org/apache-hadoop-ecosystem/?a_aid=bartoszmiedeksza&amp;a_bid=45f0d439'>Software Developer&#8217;s Journal edition on Hadoop</a> The kind folks at the Software Developer&#8217;s Journal have allowed us to reprint his article in full below.</em></p>

<p><em>Alex started writing Hive UDFs as part of the process to write the <a href='https://github.com/snowplow/snowplow/tree/master/3-etl/hive-etl/snowplow-log-deserializers'>Snowplow log deserializer</a> - the custom SerDe used to parse Snowplow logs generated by the Cloudfront and Clojure collectors so they can be processed in the Snowplow ETL step.</em></p>

<h2 id='article_synopsis'>Article Synopsis</h2>

<p>In this article you will learn how to write a user-defined function (&#8220;UDF&#8221;) to work with the Apache Hive platform. We will start gently with an introduction to Hive, then move on to developing the UDF and writing tests for it. We will write our UDF in Java, but use Scala&#8217;s SBT as our build tool and write our tests in Scala with Specs2.</p>

<p>In order to get the most out of this article, you should be comfortable programming in Java. You do not need to have any experience with Apache Hive, HiveQL (the Hive query language) or indeed Hive UDFs - I will introduce all of these concepts from first principles. Experience with Scala is advantageous, but not necessary.</p>

			<h1><a href="/blog/2013/02/04/help-us-build-out-the-snowplow-event-model">Help us build out the Snowplow Event Model</a></h1>
			<p>At its beating heart, Snowplow is a platform for capturing, storing and analysing event-data, with a real focus on web event data.</p>

<p>Working out how best to structure the Snowplow event data is key to making Snowplow a success. One of the things that has surprised us, since we started working on Snowplow, is the extent to which our view of the best way to structure that data has changed over time.</p>

<p>In this blog post, we outline our vision for the Snowplow event data model. We do so to elicit feedback and invite collaboration with the wider Snowplow community. Developing a data model that will work well for <strong>everyone</strong> will only be possible with input from a broad set of people from a wide range of companies performing analytics on a wide range of businesses. We&#8217;ve been fortunate to work with a wide range of businesses who&#8217;ve helped shape our thinking so far. We hope to talk to many more to help us on our journey to develop the Snowplow Event Model.</p>

			<h1><a href="/blog/2013/01/29/snowplow-0.7.2-released">Snowplow 0.7.2 released, with the new no-JavaScript tracker</a></h1>
			<p>We&#8217;re excited to announce the release of Snowplow version <strong>0.7.2</strong>. As well as a couple of bug fixes, this release includes our second Snowplow tracker - the <a href='/no-js-tracker.html'>No-JS Tracker</a>, to be used in web environments where a JavaScript-based tracker is not an option.</p>

<p>One of the bug fixes is particularly important: we are recommending that <strong>all users of the Clojure-based Collector upgrade</strong> to the new version (0.2.0) due to a serious bug in the way that event timestamps were recorded.</p>

<p>But first let&#8217;s look at the No-JS Tracker, and then talk about the other fixes:</p>

<h2 id='introducing_the_nojavascript_tracker'>Introducing the No-JavaScript Tracker</h2>

<p>The <a href='/no-js-tracker.html'>No-JS Tracker</a> (or &#8216;pixel tracker&#8217;) can be used to log web events in environments that do not support Javascript. Examples of events include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Views an HTML email</li>

<li>Views of product listing on a 3rd party marketplace</li>

<li>Views a page on a 3rd party hosting site</li>
</ul>

<p>Our <a href='/no-js-tracker.html'>No-JS Tracking tag wizard</a> makes it easier to generate pure-HTML tracking tags. Were you to embed these in email marketing messages, for example, you would be able to compare the behaviour of users on your website who had opened specific messages with those who had not. The <a href='/no-js-tracker.html'>No-JS Tracker</a> enables you to track a broader set of user events in Snowplow, so providing greater coverage of your users&#8217; journeys. For more information on the <a href='/no-js-tracker.html'>No-JS tracker</a> see the <a href='/blog/2013/01/29/introducing-the-no-js-tracker/'>blog post</a>.</p>

			<h1><a href="/blog/2013/01/29/introducing-the-no-js-tracker">Introducing the No-Javascript pixel tracker</a></h1>
			<p>The <a href='/no-js-tracker.html'>No-Javascript tracker</a> (pixel tracker) enables companies running Snowplow to track users in environments that do not support Javascript. In this blog post we will cover:</p>

<ol>
<li><a href='/blog/2013/01/29/introducing-the-no-js-tracker#why'>The purpose of the No-Javascript tracker (pixel tracker)</a></li>

<li><a href='/blog/2013/01/29/introducing-the-no-js-tracker#mechanics'>How it works</a></li>

<li><a href='/blog/2013/01/29/introducing-the-no-js-tracker#collector-considerations'>Considerations when using the No-JS tracker (pixel tracker) with the Clojure collector in particular</a></li>

<li><a href='/blog/2013/01/29/introducing-the-no-js-tracker#roadmap'>Next steps on the Snowplow tracker roadmap</a></li>
</ol>
<a name='why'><h2>What is the purpose of the No-Javascript tracker (pixel tracker)?</h2> </a>
<p>Our aim with Snowplow has been to enables companies to track user events across <strong>all</strong> platforms and devices. That means enabling tracking offline events, as well as online events, and mobile events, as well as web events.</p>

<p>There is a whole class of web event that Snowplow users may want to capture, but which are not possible to track using our standard Javascript tracker because they are environments that do not support Javascript. This includes:</p>

<ol>
<li>Views of HTML emails</li>

<li>Views of ecommerce products on 3rd party marketplaces</li>

<li>Views of pages on 3rd party hosting sites e.g. Github</li>
</ol>

<p>In these cases, you can use the <a href='/no-js-tracker.html'>No-Javascript tracker</a> (pixel tracker) to track events directly into your Snowplow stack. Doing so enables you to analyse complete customer journeys: tying together data on the emails a user has opened with their subsequent web browsing behaviour, for example.</p>

			<h1><a href="/blog/2013/01/22/snowplow-0.7.1-released">Snowplow 0.7.1 released, with easier-to-run Ruby apps</a></h1>
			<p>We&#8217;re happy to announce the release of Snowplow version <strong>0.7.1</strong>. This release is designed to make it much easier to install and run the two Snowplow Ruby applications:</p>

<ol>
<li><a href='https://github.com/snowplow/snowplow/tree/master/3-etl/emr-etl-runner'>EmrEtlRunner</a> - which runs the Snowplow ETL job</li>

<li><a href='https://github.com/snowplow/snowplow/tree/master/4-storage/storage-loader'>StorageLoader</a> - which loads Snowplow events into Infobright</li>
</ol>

<p>From the feedback we received, setting up and running these two Ruby apps was the most challenging (and error-prone) part of the Snowplow experience. Many thanks to all of those in the community who reported bugs with our original approach and suggested fixes!</p>

<p>To streamline this process and reduce the chances of problems occurring, we have updated both Ruby apps to work in a <a href='https://rvm.io/integration/bundler/'>RVM+Bundler</a> environment, inline with Ruby community best practice. Specifically, we have:</p>

<ul>
<li>Created a simple <a href='https://github.com/snowplow/snowplow/wiki/Ruby-and-RVM-setup'>guide to setting up Ruby and RVM</a> ready for Snowplow</li>

<li>Updated both of our Ruby apps to use RVM and Bundler</li>

<li>Updated our cronjob shell scripts to work with RVM and Bundler</li>

<li>Updated the setup guides (<a href='https://github.com/snowplow/snowplow/wiki/EmrEtlRunner-setup'>EmrEtlRunner</a>; <a href='https://github.com/snowplow/snowplow/wiki/StorageLoader-setup'>StorageLoader</a>) for both apps to follow RVM and Bundler best practice</li>
</ul>

<p>This release bumps EmrEtlRunner to version 0.0.8 and StorageLoader to version 0.0.4.</p>

<p>And that&#8217;s it! Hopefully this release fixes all of the Ruby-related issues encountered by Snowplow users - but of course there might still be a couple of teething issues. If you spot anything that still doesn&#8217;t seem right, do please <a href='https://github.com/snowplow/snowplow/issues'>raise an issue</a> or get in touch with us via <a href='https://github.com/snowplow/snowplow/wiki/Talk-to-us'>the usual channels</a>.</p>
