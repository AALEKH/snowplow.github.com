<p>Web analysts spend a lot of time exploring where visitors to their websites come from:</p>

<ul>
<li>Which sites and marketing campaigns are driving visitors to your website?</li>

<li>How valuable are those visitors?</li>

<li>What should you be doing to drive up the number of high quality users? (In terms of spending more marketing, engaging with other websites / blogs / social networks etc.)</li>
</ul>

<p>Unfortunately, identifying where your visitors come from is <strong>not</strong> as straightforward as it often seems. In this post, we will cover:</p>

<ol>
<li><a href='/blog/2013/05/10/where-does-your-traffic-really-come-from/#how'>How, technically, can we determine where visitors have come from?</a></li>

			<h1><a href="/blog/2013/05/08/snowplow-0.8.2-released-with-clojure-collector-enhancements">Snowplow 0.8.2 released with Clojure Collector enhancements</a></h1>
			<p>We&#8217;re pleased to announce the immediate availability of Snowplow <strong>0.8.2</strong>. This release updates the Clojure Collector only; if you are using the CloudFront Collector, then no upgrade to 0.8.2 is necessary.</p>

<p>Many thanks to community member <a href='https://github.com/butlermh'>Mark H. Butler</a> for his major contributions to this release - much appreciated Mark!</p>

<p>This release bumps the Clojure Collector to version <strong>0.4.0</strong>. There are three main changes to the Collector:</p>

<ol>
<li>Building the Collector&#8217;s warfile is now much simpler, thanks to a new <code>lein aws</code> command contributed by Mark</li>

<li>We have fixed a bug (<a href='https://github.com/snowplow/snowplow/issues/220'>#220</a>) where occasionally the Collector&#8217;s event logging would log <code>&quot;&quot;</code> (empty string) rather than <code>&quot;-&quot;</code> for a missing referer. While rare, when this occurred this would cause the Snowplow ETL process to break (requiring manual editing of the offending log file)</li>

<li>Some code tidy-up, including making the Clojure Collector work with newer versions of Leiningen</li>
</ol>

<p>To upgrade to this release:</p>

<ol>
<li>Download the new warfile by right-clicking on <a href='http://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/snowplow-hosted-assets/2-collectors/clojure-collector/clojure-collector-0.4.0-standalone.war'>this link</a> and selecting &#8220;Save As&#8230;&#8221;</li>

<li>Log in to your Amazon Elastic Beanstalk console</li>

<li>Browse to your Collector&#8217;s application</li>

<li>Click the &#8220;Upload New Version&#8221; and upload your warfile</li>
</ol>

<p>And that should be it. Thanks again to Mark for his contribution to this release - and we&#8217;re excited to have some further community contributions coming very soon to Snowplow, so watch this space!</p>

			23 Apr 2013
			<h1><a href="/blog/2013/04/23/performing-funnel-analysis-with-snowplow">Funnel analysis with Snowplow (Platform analytics part 1)</a></h1>
			<p><a href='/blog/2013/04/12/online-catalog-analytics-with-snowplow/'>Eleven days ago</a>, we started building out the <a href='/analytics/catalog-analytics/overview.html'>Catalog Analytics</a> section of the <a href='/analytics/index.html'>Analytics Cookbook</a>, with a set of recipes covering how to measure the performance of <a href='/analytics/catalog-analytics/measuring-and-comparing-content-page-performance.html'>content pages</a> and <a href='/analytics/catalog-analytics/measuring-and-comparing-product-page-performance.html'>product pages</a>.</p>

<p>Today we&#8217;ve published the first set of recipes in the new <a href='/analytics/platform-analytics/overview.html'>platform analytics</a> section of the Cookbook. By &#8216;platform analytics&#8217;, we mean analytics performed to answer questions about how your platform (or &#8216;website&#8217;, &#8216;application&#8217; or &#8216;product&#8217;) performs. This is one of the most important branches of analytics that can be performed with clickstream, event data.</p>

<p>The first recipes published cover how to perform <a href='/analytics/platform-analytics/funnel-analysis.html'>funnel analysis</a> with Snowplow, like the example below, that compares the purchase funnel for an online shop by month.</p>

<p><img alt='funnel-analysis' src='/static/img/analytics/platform-analytics/funnel-analysis/visualization-in-tableau.jpg' /></p>

<p>Funnel analysis is an important example of platform analytics. Snowplow makes it straightforward to define and analyse funnels on the fly: unlike Google Analytics, you do not have to predefine funnels in advance, then collect data, before you can analyse how users progress through them. This is important as it makes it possible to spot e.g. that your visitors are using your platform in a particular (perhaps unexpected) way, and then immediately drill into how many exactly, are doing so, and at what point in that workflow do different users &#8216;drop out&#8217; of the funnel.</p>

<p>In addition, Snowplow also makes it easy to compare multiple funnels (e.g. like the time series example above, or, instead, comparing how successfully different audience segments progress through different funnels).</p>

<p>This will be the first of many platform analytics recipes - if there are specific analyses you&#8217;d like us to cover, or would like to contribute yourself, then let us know below or by <a href='/contact/index.html'>getting in touch</a> directly.</p>

			<h1><a href="/blog/2013/04/18/measuring-content-page-performance-with-snowplow">Measuring content page performance with Snowplow (Catalog Analytics part 2)</a></h1>
			<p><em>This is the second part in our blog post series on Catalog Analytics. The <a href='/blog/2013/04/12/online-catalog-analytics-with-snowplow/'>first part</a> was published last week.</em></p>

<p>Last week, we started building out the <a href='/analytics/catalog-analytics/overview.html'>Catalog Analytics</a> section of the <a href='/analytics/index.html'>Analytics Cookbook</a>, with a section documenting how to <a href='/analytics/catalog-analytics/measuring-and-comparing-product-page-performance.html'>measure the effectiveness of your product pages</a>. Those recipes were geared specifically towards retailers.</p>

<p>This week, we&#8217;ve added an extra section to the cookbook, covering <a href='/analytics/catalog-analytics/measuring-and-comparing-content-page-performance.html'>how to measure engagement levels with content pages</a>. The recipes covered should be of interest to any company that produces content-rich web pages. (Indeed, all the example analytics were performed using data from this very website.) However, they should be of special interest to publishers and newspaper sites that depend on driving high levels of user engagement with content to make money</p>

<p>In the new section, we cover a range of recipes, including comparing web pages by what fraction of them is read, on average, by visitors to those pages:</p>

			<h1><a href="/blog/2013/04/12/snowplow-0.8.1-released-with-referer-url-parsing">Snowplow 0.8.1 released with referer URL parsing</a></h1>
			<p>Just nine days after our Snowplow 0.8.0 release, we are pleased to have our next release ready: Snowplow <strong>0.8.1</strong>. With the last release we promised that the new Scalding-based ETL/enrichment process would lay a strong technical foundation for our roadmap - and hopefully this release bears that out!</p>

<p>Until this release, Snowplow has provided users the raw referer URL, from which analysts can deduce who the referer was. In this release, Snowplow processes that referer URL to identify what drove a visitor to your website, specifically:</p>

<ol>
<li>Were they driven by a search engine, social network, or link in an email program?</li>

<li>If so, which search engine / social network / email program?</li>

<li>If they were driven by a search engine, what query did they enter?</li>
</ol>

<p>This data is key for performing attribution analytics.</p>

<p>Snowplow delivers the above functionality by parsing the page referer URIs which the JavaScript tracker sends to the collector. The Snowplow enrichment layer does a couple of things with these referer URIs:</p>

<ol>
<li>It splits the referer URL into its six components (scheme, host, port, path, query, fragment). This makes querying referer data significantly easier, as we hope to show in future blog posts and attribution analytics recipes</li>

<li>It looks up the referer URL in a database of known referers and attempts to extract details about this referer, which you can then use for marketing attribution. (For example - is the referer a search engine, or social network? What query did the user enter in the search engine?)</li>
</ol>

<p>We will publish a post on how to use the data in a blog post in the near-future. In the rest of this post, then, we will cover:</p>
