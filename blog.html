			<h1><a href="/blog/2013/01/21/working-out-what-data-to-pass-into-your-tag-manager">Implementing tag management - working out what data to pass into your tag management solution</a></h1>
			<p>Since Google launched <a href='https://www.google.com/tagmanager/'>Google Tag Manager</a>, a plethora of blog posts have been published on the value of tag management solutions. What has been left out of much of the discussion is practical advice on how to setup your tag management solution (be it <a href='https://www.google.com/tagmanager/'>GTM</a> or <a href='http://www.opentag.qubitproducts.com/'>OpenTag</a> or one of the paid solutions), and, crucially, what data you should be passing into your tag manager. In this post, we will outline a methodology for identifying all the relevant data you should be passing in, and bringing that methodology to life with a real-world example.</p>
<img src='/static/img/tag-management/tag-management-schematic.gif' width='320' />
<h2 id='why_is_it_important_to_define_at_implementation_time_what_data_to_pass_to_your_tag_manager'>Why is it important to define, at implementation time, what data to pass to your tag manager?</h2>

<p>One of the things we hear a lot from proponents of tag management (especially from web analyts) is that they make it easy to capture data from web pages. Indeed, the <em>best</em> solutions enable analysts with no development knowledge to identify and capture new data points, to pass onto their web analytics program, without any programming knowledge.</p>

			<h1><a href="/blog/2013/01/20/snowplow-hits-202-stars">SnowPlow reaches 202 stars on GitHub</a></h1>
			<p>As of this weekend, the SnowPlow repository on GitHub now has over 200 stars! We&#8217;re hugely excited to reach this milestone - this makes us:</p>

<ul>
<li>The 3rd most-watched analytics project on GitHub, after <a href='https://github.com/mnutt/hummingbird'>Hummingbird</a> (real-time analytics) and <a href='https://github.com/Countly/countly-server'>Countly</a> (mobile analytics)</li>

<li>The <a href='https://github.com/languages/Scala/most_watched?page=3'>58th most-watched</a> Scala project on GitHub</li>
</ul>

<p>Many thanks to everyone in the SnowPlow community and on GitHub for their support and interest!</p>

<p>We thought it might be interesting to share the <a href='http://jrvis.com/red-dwarf/?user=snowplow&amp;repo=snowplow'>Red Dwarf heatmap</a> of where our 202 GitHub stars are located across the world:</p>

<p><img src='/static/img/blog/2013/01/snowplow-stars-at-202.png' alt='heatmap' /></p>

<p>Beyond the &#8220;hot spots&#8221; in the US and Europe, it&#8217;s encouraging to see growing interest in SnowPlow from South America, South/East Asia and Australia/New Zealand. We look forward to checking back on the heatmap when we have some more stars!</p>

		<a name="Using OpenTag with SnowPlow" />
		<div class="post">
			18 Jan 2013
			<h1><a href="/blog/2013/01/18/using-snowplow-with-qubit-opentag">Implementing SnowPlow with QuBit's OpenTag</a></h1>
			<p>This is a short blog post to highlight a new section on the <a href='https://github.com/snowplow/snowplow/wiki/SnowPlow-setup-guide'>SnowPlow setup guide</a> covering <a href='https://github.com/snowplow/snowplow/wiki/Integrating%20Javascript%20tags%20with%20QuBit%20OpenTag'>how to integrate SnowPlow with QuBit&#8217;s OpenTag tag management system</a>.</p>

<p>In November last year, we started playing with tag management systems: testing SnowPlow with Google Tag Manager, and documented how to setup SnowPlow with GTM on the <a href='https://github.com/snowplow/snowplow/wiki/Integrating-javascript-tags-with-Google-Tag-Manager'>SnowPlow setup guide</a>. We were impressed on a number of fronts, but thought that the much more thought need to be put into what data was passed into the tag management system than people typically admit. (We documented our thoughts, at the time, on <a href='/blog/2012/11/16/integrating-snowplow-with-google-tag-manager/'>this blog post</a>.)</p>

<p>Since then, we&#8217;ve recommended that <strong>all</strong> new SnowPlow users setup a tag management system, prior to integrating SnowPlow on their website, if they have not already done so. The benefits of doing so are well documented elsewhere. For SnowPlow users, there are two big benefits in particular, that we will flag:</p>

<ol>
<li>Going through the exercise of implementing a tag management solution forces companies to take a rigorous look at the data they pass from their website into the tag manager, especially when declaring the data explicitly using things like the <code>dataLayer</code> (in GTM) or the <code>Universal Variable</code> in OpenTag. This makes it easier for analysts, down the line, to understand <em>what</em> data has been passed into their web analytics system, and how that data has been generated: key bits of information that can often get lost months after web analytics platforms like SnowPlow have been implemented. In addition, it makes the analytics as a whole more robust, as the generation of data is decoupled from the generation of other elements of web pages, which means web developers can continue to improve site functionality, safe in the knowledge they wont break anything on the analytics side.</li>

<li>A selfish reason, perhaps, but having our customers use a tag management platforms gives us the freedom to improve SnowPlow tracking tags where we see the opportunity, safe in the knowledge that we&#8217;re not causing our clients too much difficulty to upgrade their tags.</li>
</ol>

<p><img src='/static/img/blog/2013/01/qubit-opentag.png' alt='qubit-opentag-logo' /></p>

<p>We were eager, having integrated SnowPlow with GTM, to integrate it with an open source tag management system. After all, a big selling point of SnowPlow is that it is open source: enabling companies to setup, own and manage their own data infrastructure, without relying on a third party to mediate their access to their own data. We were therefore delighted that QuBit has developed an open source tag management system, <a href='http://www.opentag.qubitproducts.com/'>OpenTag</a>, and that we have finally documented <a href='https://github.com/snowplow/snowplow/wiki/Integrating%20Javascript%20tags%20with%20QuBit%20OpenTag'>how to integrate it with SnowPlow</a>.</p>

<p>There is a lot we like about QuBit&#8217;s OpenTag:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Open source</strong>. You can view the <a href='https://github.com/QubitProducts/OpenTag/blob/master/OpenTag.js'>OpenTag.js</a> on Github to get a handle on exactly how OpenTag works</li>

<li><strong>Low cost hosted service</strong>. QuBit offers free hosting for sites with less than 1M page views per month, and $99 per 10M page views thereafter</li>

<li><strong>Easy-to-implement host-yourself option</strong>. You can use OpenTag&#8217;s web UI to configure all your tags for free and publish the results to a Javascript file that you can then host on your own CDN (e.g. Amazon Cloudfront). By not using Qubit to host the configured javascript file with all your different tags, you are not locked into QuBit as a vendor. In addition, the cost of managing your tags across large sites, content networks and ad networks is kept at a bare minimum.</li>
</ol>

<p>In order to make it easier for new SnowPlow users to implement OpenTag alongside SnowPlow, and existing OpenTag users to implement SnowPlow, we&#8217;ve documented how to setup SnowPlow in OpenTag on our <a href='https://github.com/snowplow/snowplow/wiki/Integrating%20Javascript%20tags%20with%20QuBit%20OpenTag'>setup guide</a>.</p>

<p>Keep plowing!</p>

		<a name="Scala MaxMind GeoIP released" />
		<div class="post">
			16 Jan 2013
			<h1><a href="/blog/2013/01/16/scala-maxmind-geoip-released">Scala MaxMind GeoIP library released</a></h1>
			<p>A short blog post this, to announce the release of <a href='https://github.com/snowplow/scala-maxmind-geoip'><strong>Scala MaxMind GeoIP</strong></a>, our Scala wrapper for the MaxMind <a href='http://www.maxmind.com/download/geoip/api/java/'>Java Geo-IP</a> library.</p>

<p>We have extracted Scala MaxMind GeoIP from our current (ongoing) work porting our ETL process from Apache Hive to <a href='https://github.com/twitter/scalding'>Scalding</a>. We extracted this as a separate library for two main reasons:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Being good open-source citizens</strong> - as with our <a href='https://github.com/snowplow/referer-parser'>referer-parser</a> library, we believe this library willl be useful to the wider community of software developers, not just SnowPlow users</li>

<li><strong>Keeping SnowPlow&#8217;s footprint small</strong> - at SnowPlow we believe very strongly in building modular, loosely-coupled software. Massive monolithic systems that &#8216;do everything&#8217; are a nightmare to test, maintain and extend - so we prefer to build small, standalone components and libraries which we (and the community) can then compose into larger pipelines and processes</li>
</ol>

<p>On to the library: for Scala developers, the main benefits of using <a href='https://github.com/snowplow/scala-maxmind-geoip'>scala-maxmind-geoip</a> over the MaxMind Java library are:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Easier to setup/test</strong> - the SBT project definition automatically pulls down the latest MaxMind Java code and <code>GeoLiteCity.dat</code></li>

<li><strong>Better type safety</strong> - the MaxMind Java library is somewhat null-happy. This library uses Option boxing wherever possible</li>

<li><strong>Better performance</strong> - as well as or instead of using MaxMind&#8217;s own caching (<code>GEOIP_MEMORY_CACHE</code>), you can also configure an LRU (Least Recently Used) cache of variable size</li>
</ul>

<p>That&#8217;s it! And if you have any problems with this Scala library for MaxMind GeoIP lookups, please <a href='https://github.com/snowplow/snowplow/issues'>raise an issue</a> or get in touch with us via <a href='https://github.com/snowplow/snowplow/wiki/Talk-to-us'>the usual channels</a>.</p>

			<h1><a href="/blog/2013/01/09/from-etl-to-enrichment">The SnowPlow development roadmap for the ETL step - from ETL to enrichment</a></h1>
			<p>In this blog post, we outline our plans to develop the <a href='https://github.com/snowplow/snowplow/wiki/etl'>ETL</a> (&#8220;extract, transform and load&#8221;) part of the SnowPlow stack. Although in many respects the least sexy element of the stack, it is critical to SnowPlow, and we intend to re-architect the ETL step in quite significant ways. In this post, we discuss our plans and the rationale behind them, in the hope to get:</p>

<ol>
<li>Feedback from the community on them</li>

<li>Ideas for alternative approaches or new features</li>
</ol>

<p>We will cover:</p>

<ol>
<li><a href='/blog/2013/01/09/from-etl-to-enrichment/#purpose'>Recap: the point of the ETL step</a></li>

<li><a href='/blog/2013/01/09/from-etl-to-enrichment/#limitations'>Limitations with the current, Hive-based ETL process</a></li>

<li><a href='/blog/2013/01/09/from-etl-to-enrichment/#enrichment'>From ETL to enrichment</a>: what we want the ETL step to achieve</li>

<li><a href='/blog/2013/01/09/from-etl-to-enrichment/#speed'>Towards a real-time ETL</a>: speeding things up</li>

<li><a href='/blog/2013/01/09/from-etl-to-enrichment/#scalding'>Moving to Cascading / Scalding</a>: what we plan to do</li>

<li><a href='/blog/2013/01/09/from-etl-to-enrichment/#benefits'>Benefits of this approach</a>: both in the short and long term</li>
</ol>

<p>To get the conversation started, a conceptual map of the new ETL process is shown below. You will probably want to click on it to see a blown-up PDF version, as it is rather large:</p>
