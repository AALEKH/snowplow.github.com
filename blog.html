			<p><em>The SnowPlow platform is built standing on the shoulders of a whole host of different open source frameworks, libraries and tools. Without the amazing ongoing work by these individuals, companies and not-for-profits, the SnowPlow project literally could not exist.</em></p>

<p><em>As part of our &#8220;Inside the Plow&#8221; series, we will also be showcasing some of these core components of the SnowPlow stack, and talking to their creators. To kick us off, we are delighted to have <a href='https://twitter.com/robslifka'>Rob Slifka</a>, VP of <a href='http://www.sharethrough.com/engineering'>Engineering</a> at <a href='http://www.sharethrough.com'>Sharethrough</a> in San Francisco, talking to us about his <a href='https://github.com/rslifka/elasticity'>Elasticity</a> project. For those who aren&#8217;t aware: Elasticity is a Ruby library which we use as part of our <a href='https://github.com/snowplow/snowplow/wiki/setting-up-EmrEtlRunner'>EmrEtlRunner</a>, to make it easy to automate the SnowPlow ETL Job on Amazon Elastic MapReduce. The Elasticity library is a great piece of tech - and indeed was a major factor in us deciding to write EmrEtlRunner in Ruby.</em></p>

<p><em>With the introductions done, let&#8217;s hand over to Rob to tell us a bit about himself, Elasticity and what he&#8217;s working on next:</em></p>

<p>Thanks Alex! Quick bit about me: I&#8217;ve been in software development since the mid 90s working on everything from Java Swing (design automation tools) to embedded Jetty (email encryption) and now a mixture of Ruby and Scala. Since 2010, I’ve been responsible for <a href='http://www.sharethrough.com/engineering'>engineering</a> at <a href='http://www.sharethrough.com'>Sharethrough</a> - an ad tech company based out of San Francisco. We’re building a native advertising platform based on the belief that advertising is no longer sustainable as banners and punch-the-monkey ads and has begun the transition to engaging, non-interruptive choice-based experiences. One thing that a lot of people outside of ad tech don’t realize is that online advertising is synonymous with scale and some of the most interesting technology problems are driven from those demands. This is where <a href='https://github.com/rslifka/elasticity'>Elasticity</a> comes in.</p>

			<p>We&#8217;re excited to announce the immediate release of SnowPlow version <strong>0.7.6</strong> with support for storing your SnowPlow events in <a href='http://aws.amazon.com/redshift/'>Amazon Redshift</a>.</p>

<p>We were very excited when Amazon announced Redshift back in late 2012, and we have been working to integrate SnowPlow data since Redshift became generally available two weeks ago. Our tests with Redshift since launch have not disappointed - and we can&#8217;t wait to see what the SnowPlow community do with the new platform!</p>

<p>In this post we will cover:</p>

			<h1><a href="/blog/2013/02/25/snowplow-0.7.5-released-with-important-javascript-fix">SnowPlow 0.7.5 released with important JavaScript fix</a></h1>
			<p>We are releasing SnowPlow version <strong>0.7.5</strong> - which upgrades the JavaScript tracker to version <strong>0.11.1</strong>. This is a small but important release - because we are fixing an issue introduced in SnowPlow version a month ago: <strong>if you are on versions 0.9.1 to 0.11.0 of the JavaScript tracker, please upgrade!</strong></p>

<p>Essentially, version 0.9.1 of the JavaScript tracker (released in SnowPlow 0.7.2) fixed <a href='https://github.com/snowplow/snowplow/pull/147'>an old bug</a> which we inherited from the Piwik JavaScript tracker when we forked it early last year; this bug was stopping the secure flag from being set on SnowPlow&#8217;s first-party cookies when sent via HTTPS pages.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, fixing this bug caused a larger problem: sending cookies securely from HTTPS pages meant that HTTP pages could no longer read the cookies, causing the cookies to be regenerated. As a result, SnowPlow&#8217;s <code>domain_userid</code> field (the first-party user ID) was being <strong>reset</strong> when a user browsed from an HTTPS page (e.g. checkout) back to an HTTP page.</p>

<p>So, this release fixes <a href='https://github.com/snowplow/snowplow/issues/181'>a nasty bug</a>. Thanks to the Piwik team for their help in brainstorming this problem!</p>

<p>Please update your website(s) to use the latest version of the JavaScript tracker, which is version 0.11.1. As always, the updated minified tracker is available here:</p>

<pre><code>http(s)://d1fc8wv8zag5ca.cloudfront.net/0.11.1/sp.js</code></pre>

<p>As always, if you do run into any issues or don&#8217;t understand any of the above changes, please <a href='https://github.com/snowplow/snowplow/issues'>raise an issue</a> or get in touch with us via <a href='https://github.com/snowplow/snowplow/wiki/Talk-to-us'>the usual channels</a>.</p>

			<h1><a href="/blog/2013/02/22/snowplow-0.7.4-released-for-better-eventstream-analytics">SnowPlow 0.7.4 released for better eventstream analytics</a></h1>
			<p>Another week, another release! We&#8217;re excited to announce SnowPlow version <strong>0.7.4</strong>. The primary purpose of this release is to clean up and rationalise our event data model, in particular around <strong>user IDs</strong> and <strong>event timestamps</strong>. This release should lay the foundations for more sophisticated eventstream analytics (such as funnel analysis), by:</p>

<ul>
<li>Enabling companies to assign custom user IDs (e.g. when a customer logs on)</li>

<li>Distinguish between IDs set at a domain level (via first-party cookies) and at a network level (via third-party cookies)</li>

<li>Enable precise ordering of events in a user&#8217;s click stream with accuracy correct to the milli-second</li>
</ul>

<p>Many thanks to SnowPlow users <a href='http://www.simplybusiness.co.uk/'>Simply Business</a> and <a href='https://github.com/shermozle'>Simon Rumble</a> (APN) for suggesting many of these changes and helping us to design them.</p>

		<a name="Bulk loading data from Amazon S3 into Redshift at the command line" />

			20 Feb 2013
			<h1><a href="/blog/2013/02/20/transferring-data-from-s3-to-redshift-at-the-command-line">Bulk loading data from Amazon S3 into Redshift at the command line</a></h1>
			<p>On Friday Amazon launched <a href='http://aws.amazon.com/redshift/'>Redshift</a>, a fully managed, petabyte-scale data warehouse service. We&#8217;ve been busy since building out SnowPlow support for Redshift, so that SnowPlow users can use Redshift to store their granular, customer-level and event-level data for OLAP analysis.</p>

<p>In the course of building out SnowPlow support for Redshift, we need to bulk load data stored in S3 into Redshift, programmatically. Unfortunately, the Redshift Java SDK is very slow at inserts, so not suitable bulk loading. We found a simple workaround that might be helpful for anyone who wishes to bulk load data into Redshift from S3, and have documented it below.</p>

<h2 id='an_overview_of_the_workaround'>An overview of the workaround</h2>

<p>Amazon enables users to bulk load data from S3 into Redshift by executing queries with the following form:</p>

<p>However, these queries can only be executed in a SQL client running a JDBC or ODBC driver compatible with Redshift. (Links to those drivers can be found <a href='http://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/gsg/before-you-begin.html#getting-started-download-tools'>here</a>. )</p>
