			<h1><a href="/blog/2013/04/12/snowplow-0.8.1-released-with-referer-url-parsing">Snowplow 0.8.1 released with referer URL parsing</a></h1>
			 <span class="author">Author: <a href="/alex.html" rel="author">Alex Dean </a></span>
			<p>Just nine days after our Snowplow 0.8.0 release, we are pleased to have our next release ready: Snowplow <strong>0.8.1</strong>. With the last release we promised that the new Scalding-based ETL/enrichment process would lay a strong technical foundation for our roadmap - and hopefully this release bears that out!</p>

<p>Until this release, Snowplow has provided users the raw referer URL, from which analysts can deduce who the referer was. In this release, Snowplow processes that referer URL to identify what drove a visitor to your website, specifically:</p>

<ol>
<li>Were they driven by a search engine, social network, or link in an email program?</li>

<li>If so, which search engine / social network / email program?</li>

<li>If they were driven by a search engine, what query did they enter?</li>
</ol>

<p>This data is key for performing attribution analytics.</p>

<p>Snowplow delivers the above functionality by parsing the page referer URIs which the JavaScript tracker sends to the collector. The Snowplow enrichment layer does a couple of things with these referer URIs:</p>

<ol>
<li>It splits the referer URL into its six components (scheme, host, port, path, query, fragment). This makes querying referer data significantly easier, as we hope to show in future blog posts and attribution analytics recipes</li>

<li>It looks up the referer URL in a database of known referers and attempts to extract details about this referer, which you can then use for marketing attribution. (For example - is the referer a search engine, or social network? What query did the user enter in the search engine?)</li>
</ol>

<p>We will publish a post on how to use the data in a blog post in the near-future. In the rest of this post, then, we will cover:</p>

			<h1><a href="/blog/2013/04/10/snowplow-event-validation">Towards high-fidelity web analytics - introducing Snowplow's innovative new event validation capabilities</a></h1>
			 <span class="author">Author: <a href="/alex.html" rel="author">Alex Dean </a></span>
			<p>A key goal of the Snowplow project is enabling <strong>high-fidelity analytics</strong> for businesses running Snowplow.</p>

<p>What do we mean by high-fidelity analytics? Simply put, high-fidelity analytics means Snowplow faithfully recording <em>all</em> customer events in a rich, granular, non-lossy and unopinionated way.</p>

<p>This data is incredibly valuable: it enables companies to better understand their customers and develop and tailor products and services to them. Ensuring that the data is high fidelity is essential to ensuring that any operational and strategic decision making that&#8217;s made on the basis of that data is sound. Guaranteeing data fidelity is not a sexy topic. But it&#8217;s an important one.</p>

<p>Surprisingly, ensuring your data is high fidelity is <strong>not</strong> something that is enforced by other analytics products.</p>

<p><img alt='high-fidelity' src='/static/img/blog/2013/04/high-fidelity-2000.jpg' /></p>

<p>Why is Snowplow so unusual in aiming for high-fidelity analytics? Most often, analytics vendors sacrifice the goal of high-fidelity data at the altar of these three compromises:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Premature aggregation</strong> - when the data store gets too large, or the reports take too long to generate, it&#8217;s tempting to perform the aggregation and roll-up of the raw event data earlier, sometimes even at the point of collection. Of course this offers a huge potential performance boost to the tool, but at the cost of a huge degree of customer data fidelity</li>

<li><strong>Ignoring bad news</strong> - the nature of event data means that often incomplete, corrupted or plain wrong data is sent in to the analytics tool by the event trackers. Handling bad event data is complicated (let&#8217;s go shopping!). Instead of dealing with the complexity, most analytics packages just throw the bad data away silently; this is why tag audit companies like <a href='http://www.observepoint.com/'>ObservePoint</a> exist</li>

<li><strong>Being over-opinionated</strong> - customer analytics is full of challenging questions which need answering before you can analyse the data: do I track users by their first-party cookie, third-party cookie, business ID and/or IP address? Do I use the server clock, or the user&#8217;s clock to log the event time? When does a user session start and end? Because these questions can be difficult to answer, most analytics tools don&#8217;t ask them: instead they take an opinionated view of the &#8220;right answer&#8221; and silently enforce that view through their event collection, storage and analysis. By the time users realize that the logic enforced is one that does not work for their business, they are already tied to that vendor and the imperfect data set they have created with that vendor to date.</li>
</ol>

<p>To deliver on the goal of high-fidelity analytics, then, we&#8217;re trying to steer Snowplow around these three common pitfalls as best we can.</p>

<p>We have talked in detail on our website and wiki about avoiding pitfall #1, Premature aggregation. In short: we do <strong>no</strong> aggregation - Snowplow users have access to granular, event level data, so that they can work out how best they should aggregate it for each type of analysis they wish to perform.</p>

<p>We will blog more about our ideas to combat #3, Being over-opinionated, in the future.</p>

<p>For the rest of this blog post, though, we will look at our solution to pitfall #2, Ignoring bad news: namely, <strong>event validation</strong>.</p>

			<h1><a href="/blog/2013/04/03/snowplow-0.8.0-released-with-all-new-scalding-based-data-enrichment">Snowplow 0.8.0 released with all-new Scalding-based data enrichment</a></h1>
			 <span class="author">Author: <a href="/alex.html" rel="author">Alex Dean </a></span>
			<p>A new month, a new release! We&#8217;re excited to announce the immediate availability of Snowplow version <strong>0.8.0</strong>. This has been our most complex release to date: we have done a full rewrite our ETL (aka enrichment) process, adding a few nice data quality enhancements along the way.</p>

<p>This release has been heavily informed by our January blog post, <a href='/blog/2013/01/09/from-etl-to-enrichment/#scalding'>The Snowplow development roadmap for the ETL step - from ETL to enrichment</a>. In technical terms, we have ported our existing ETL process (which was a combination of HiveQL scripts plus a custom Java deserializer) to a new Hadoop-only ETL process which does not require Hive. The new ETL process is written in Scala, using <a href='https://github.com/twitter/scalding'>Scalding</a>, a Scala API built on top of <a href='http://www.cascading.org'>Cascading</a>, the Hadoop ETL framework.</p>

<p>In the rest of this post we will cover:</p>

			<h1><a href="/blog/2013/03/25/snowplow-tracker-for-arduino-released-sensor-and-event-analytics-for-the-internet-of-things">Snowplow Arduino Tracker released - sensor and event analytics for the internet of things</a></h1>
			 <span class="author">Author: <a href="/alex.html" rel="author">Alex Dean </a></span>
			<p>Today we are releasing our first non-Web tracker for Snowplow - an event tracker for the <a href='http://www.arduino.cc/'>Arduino</a> open-source electronics prototyping platform. The <a href='https://github.com/snowplow/snowplow-arduino-tracker'>Snowplow Arduino Tracker</a> lets you track sensor and event-stream information from one or more IP-connected Arduino boards.</p>

<p>We chose this as our first non-Web tracker because we&#8217;re hugely excited about the potential of sophisticated analytics for the <a href='http://www.forbes.com/sites/ericsavitz/2013/01/14/ces-2013-the-break-out-year-for-the-internet-of-things/'>Internet of Things</a>, following in the footsteps of great projects like <a href='https://cosm.com/'>Cosm</a> and <a href='http://exosite.com/'>Exosite</a>. And of course, Snowplow&#8217;s extremely-scalable architecture is a great fit for the huge volumes of events and sensor readings which machines are able to generate - you could say that we are already &#8220;machine-scale&#8221;!</p>

<p><img alt='arduino-photo' src='/static/img/blog/2013/03/arduino-board-photo.jpg' /></p>

<p>As far as we know, this is the first time an event analytics platform has released a dedicated tracker for the maker community; we can&#8217;t wait to see what the Arduino and Snowplow communities will use it for! Some ideas we had were:</p>

<ol>
<li>Deploying a set of Snowplow-connected Arduinos to monitor the environment (temperature, humidity, light levels etc) in your home</li>

<li>Tracking the movement of products around your shop/warehouse/factory using Arduino, <a href='http://arduino.cc/blog/category/wireless/rfid/'>RFID readers</a> and Snowplow</li>

<li>Sending vehicle fleet information (locations, speeds, fuel levels etc) back to Snowplow using Arduino&#8217;s <a href='http://www.cooking-hacks.com/index.php/documentation/tutorials/arduino-3g-gprs-gsm-gps'>3G and GPS</a> shields</li>
</ol>

<p>In fact Alex has gone ahead and written a sample Arduino sketch to track temperatures and log the readings to Snowplow - you can find his project on GitHub at <a href='https://github.com/alexanderdean/arduino-temp-tracker'>alexanderdean/arduino-temp-tracker</a>.</p>

<p>Want to find out more? To get started using our event tracker for Arduino, check out:</p>

<p>Happy making!</p>
