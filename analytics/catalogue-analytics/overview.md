## Catalogue Analytics

### What do we mean by "catalogue analytics"?

If you are an online retailer, or run an media website, an integral part of your digital offering is your digital "catalogue": which contains products for sale (in the case of the retailer) or content (in the case of the media company), that may be in a variety of formats (articles, podcasts, videos etc).

### Why perform catalogue analytics?

Understanding how users engage with each item of content or each product in your catalogue, and how effectively your website enables users to navigate and engage with that content is essential to improving your digital proposition. It enables you to:

1. **Choose better items for your catalogue**. (Source better items for your online shop, if you're a retailer, or produce / commission more relevant content, for media sites.)
2. **Organise your catalogue items more effectively**. You can use Snowplow data to understand which items are interesting to which users, which items are interesting to most users, and use that to drive which products are displayed most prominently. (Even tailoring your approach to individual audience segments and individual users.)
3. **Optimise your existing content**: by tweaking prices, improving the layout etc.

In this section of the [analytics cookbook] [analytics-cookbook], we outline a range of recipes to perform catalogue analytics.
