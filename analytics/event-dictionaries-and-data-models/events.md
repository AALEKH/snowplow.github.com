# Events

An event is something that occurred in a particular point in time. Examples of events include:

* Load a web page
* Add an item to basket
* Load a bank balance
* Perform a search
* Click a link
* Like a video

Snowplow is an event analytics platform. It is built to track and store events, as they occur. Snowplow delivers a data warehouse of events that represents what has happened in the past. That is a rich and deep data set to mine to try and understand what happened and why, and use it to drive decision making and future outcomes.
