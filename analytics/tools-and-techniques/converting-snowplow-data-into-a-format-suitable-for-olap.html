<h1><a name='top'>Converting SnowPlow data into a format suitable for OLAP</a></h1>
<p>SnowPlow data is stored effectively in a log file format, where each line of data represents one &#8220;event&#8221; on a particular user journey. This data structure is unsuitable for traditional BI / analysis tools like Tableau or Pentaho, which require that the data be structured in a format suitable for OLAP analysis. (Sometimes also called <em>pivot tables</em>.) In this section of the cookbook, we describe how to restructure SnowPlow event data into a format suitable for OLAP analysis, so that it can be visualised using tools like Tableau and Pentaho.</p>

<p>Although this guide is written specifically for SnowPlow data, the basic approach to converting log format data into a structure suitable for OLAP data should work for other log or event data sets as well.</p>

<a name='why'><h3>1. Why use OLAP?</h3> </a>
<p>OLAP tools like Tableau, Pentaho and Microstrategy are very popular amongst data analysts because they</p>

<ol>
<li>Make it easy to slice data along different dimensions, exploring different relationships over time, and answering a wealth of different business questions</li>

<li>They do not require much technical knowledge to use. (E.g. no need to know SQL or Python).</li>

<li>They are well suited to &#8220;train of thought analysis&#8221; i.e. moving quickly between one view of the data and another, as insights derived from the first immediately lead to questions that are answered by the second.</li>
</ol>

<p>OLAP tools are especially well suited for SnowPlow web analytics data:</p>

<ol>
<li>There are a wide range of dimensions we might want to slice and dice web analytics data by, including time, user, visit, geography, device, browser, type of web page, web page, content and/or product, acquisition channel&#8230;</li>

<li>There are a wide variety of metrics we might want to compare between dimension combinations e.g. unique users, visits, page views, events, purchases, conversion rates, revenue&#8230;</li>

<li>Web analysts are generally very familiar with OLAP analysis / pivot tables: Google Analytics <a href='http://www.google.com/analytics/features/custom-reports.html'>cusotm reports</a> enables analysts to select metrics and dimensions like a primitive (and incredibly slow) OLAP cube, for example.</li>
</ol>

<a name='what'><h3>2. What is OLAP exactly?</h3> </a>
<h4 id='21_olap_overview'>2.1 OLAP overview</h4>

<p>OLAP is an approach for analysing multi-dimensional data. OLAP stands for &#8220;online analytics processing&#8221;, but it in fact relates to something much more tightly defined in data analytics: the treating of multidimensional data as a cube.</p>

<p>An OLAP cube is a multi-dimensional array of data. Data points are made up of one or more metrics. (In our cases, uniques, visits, page views, transactions, revenue, number of content items consumed etc.) Data can be viewed by a range of different dimensions. (In our case, examples include time of day, day in the week, time of the year, year, customer cohort, type of device, type of browser etc.) An OLAP reporting tool makes it easy for analysts to view the metrics they want, sliced by the particular dimensions they&#8217;re interested in. So, for example, if an analyst wanted to see if conversion rates had been improving over time, they might slice the conversion rates metric by the time dimension (e.g. by month), to view if there had been an improvement. If there had been an improvement, they might then drill down to see if that improvement had been across the board: was it true of all customer segments, across all device types etc.?</p>
<p style='text-align:center;'><img alt='olap cube' src='/static/img/olap/example-cube.png' width='250' /></p>
<p>When we say OLAP cube, then, we visualise a &#8220;cube&#8221; of data points (i.e. metrics) at the intersection of multiple dimensions. (Three in the case of a cube, but more often there are more dimensions. Technically we should talk in terms of a &#8220;hyper-cube&#8221;, but it doens&#8217;t really matter.)</p>

<h4 id='22_olap_operations'>2.2 OLAP operations</h4>

<h4 id='221_slicing_data'>2.2.1 Slicing data</h4>

<p>We &#8220;slice&#8221; data when we pick two dimensions to view a particular metric by. The analogy is to take a &#8220;slice&#8221; through an OLAP cube to produce a 2D data set.</p>
<p style='text-align:center;'><img alt='slice olap cube' src='/static/img/olap/slice.png' width='180' /></p>
<h4 id='222_dice_data'>2.2.2. Dice data</h4>

<p>Rather than slice data into two dimensions, we might want to create a subcube with more than 2 dimensions. This operation is called &#8220;dice&#8221;.</p>
<p style='text-align:center;'><img alt='dice olap cube' src='/static/img/olap/dice.png' width='140' /></p>
<h4 id='223_drill_up_and_drill_down'>2.2.3. Drill up and drill down</h4>

<p>OLAP dimensions are often organised in a hierarchy. To gives some examples:</p>

<pre><code>Year -&gt; Quarter -&gt; Month -&gt; Day -&gt; Hour -&gt; Minute -&gt; Second

Organic referrers -&gt; Google -&gt; specific keywords

Browser -&gt; browser version

Category -&gt; Subcategory -&gt; Product</code></pre>

<p>Drilling down refers to moving down the dimension hierarchy - e.g. from viewing sales by month to by week, and then by day. In each case, the level the metrics are being aggregated drops, so the actual numbers reported fall.</p>

<p>In contrast, drilling up means moving up the dimension hierarchy - e.g. form viewing sales by month to by year. In this case, you&#8217;re aggregating bigger data sets (a whole year&#8217;s worth of data), so the the actual numbers get larger.</p>

<h4 id='224_pivot'>2.2.4 Pivot</h4>

<p>Pivoting means swaping one dimension for another. Typically this is used in two situations:</p>

<ol>
<li>With an initial data set, to spot if there are interesting relationships between particular dimensions (e.g. product mix by city or conversion rate by time of day).</li>

<li>To better understand a relationship once one has been spotted. (Does product mix <em>only</em> vary by city? Or is it actually that user segments vary by city, and it is user segment that is predictive of product mix?)</li>
</ol>
<p style='text-align:center;'><img alt='pivot olap cube' src='/static/img/olap/pivot.png' width='140' /></p>
<p>Back to <a href='#top'>top</a>.</p>
<a name='structure'><h3>3. What structure does the data need to be in to support an OLAP cube?</h3></a>
<p>In traditional OLAP parlance, at the heart of OLAP data is a &#8220;fact table&#8221;. In SnowPlow paralance, that fact table is really an &#8220;events&#8221; table. There are two key requirements to fulfil to ensure that events data is structured in a format suitable for processing by an OLAP tool like Tableau:</p>

<ol>
<li>The granularity of the data is sufficient to support the sufficient &#8220;drill down&#8221;. So, for example, if you want to be able to drill down to an individual user level, for example, your data set has to have separate entries for each user, each differentiated by the <code>user_id</code> field. Any aggregation of users (e.g. cohorts) must happen in the OLAP tool e.g. Tableau, <strong>not</strong> in the raw data fed into Tableau</li>

<li>All the dimensional information associated with each event (or &#8220;fact&#8221;) that you want to slice / dice on must be present in the line of event data.</li>
</ol>

<p>Of the two requirements outlined above, meeting the first using SnowPlow data is easy, because SnowPlow data is already stored at the most granular level. (I.e. at least one line of data per &#8220;event&#8221;.) Meeting the second is a bit more nuanced. We discuss both below:</p>

<h4 id='31_getting_the_granularity_of_data_right'>3.1 Getting the granularity of data right</h4>

<p>The more granular our data, the more reporting flexibility we have. One of the most frequently cited complaints about Google Analytics, for example, is that the data Google provides isn&#8217;t sufficiently granular, so you cannot, for example, drill down to explore the way an individual user has engaged with your site.</p>

<p>With OLAP analysis, increased granularity doesn&#8217;t just support better drill down facilities. It also enables more pivotting possibilities - as you can slice and dice more combinations of metrics against one another.</p>

<p>So granularity is good. The good news is that SnowPlow data is very granular: at least one line of data per event. If we wanted (and it&#8217;s perfectly legitimate to), we could feed SnowPlow data into our OLAP reporting tool without aggregating it at all. However, there is a cost associated with this level of granularity: it means that the data volumes are greater, and so it is likely that the reporting tool will work more slowly. This used to be a much more important consideration (when RAM wasn&#8217;t so cheap, and before columnar databases like Infobright, in-memory databases and SSD drives). However, it is still a reasonable consideration today.</p>

<p>One example of an approach to aggregating SnowPlow data: we could aggregate it at the level of the user, session and event. (Be it a particular page load, product add to basket etc.) In this case, if we had a user who had visited a particular page 3x in one session, we would only have one line of data representing those three page views. (As opposed to having three in our original SnowPlow events data set.) This would reduce our volume of data somewhat (likely by a factor of 0.1 - 0.25), but still give us a lot of reporting flexibility. (We&#8217;d be able to drill down to the user and action level.) We would not, however, be able to perform any path analysis. (I.e. look at the sequence of events in a particular user session.) In any case, this type of analysis isn&#8217;t well supported by OLAP tools like Tableau.</p>

<h4 id='32_ensure_all_dimensions_information_associated_with_each_event_is_in_every_line_of_data'>3.2 Ensure all dimensions information associated with each event is in every line of data</h4>

<p>There are a number of dimensions that are already available on every line of SnowPlow data. For example, the browser and operating system fields are populated in every line of SnowPlow data.</p>

<p>However, there are other dimensions that are not available on every line of SnowPlow data. In fact, these dimensions need to be deduced by looking at user behaviour across multiple lines of data. To give two related examples:</p>

<p>Say we are interested in bucketing users into cohorts based on the first time they performed a particular action e.g. &#8220;signup&#8221;. Maybe we bucket users by month. Then the user cohort of each of our users can easily be derived using the following SQL:</p>
<div class='highlight'><pre><code class='mysql'><span class='k'>SELECT</span>
<span class='n'>user_id</span><span class='p'>,</span>
<span class='nf'>CONCAT</span><span class='p'>(</span><span class='kt'>YEAR</span><span class='p'>(</span><span class='nf'>MIN</span><span class='p'>(</span><span class='n'>dt</span><span class='p'>)),</span> <span class='s2'>&quot;-&quot;</span><span class='p'>,</span> <span class='nf'>MONTH</span><span class='p'>(</span><span class='nf'>MIN</span><span class='p'>(</span><span class='n'>dt</span><span class='p'>)))</span>
<span class='k'>FROM</span> <span class='n'>events</span>
<span class='k'>WHERE</span> 
<span class='n'>ev_action</span> <span class='k'>LIKE</span> <span class='s2'>&quot;signup&quot;</span>
<span class='k'>GROUP</span> <span class='k'>BY</span> <span class='n'>user_id</span>
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>However, to derive the cohort by user, we&#8217;ve had to scan all the rows of data for each of our users. When we feed our data into an OLAP reporting tool like Tableau, we need a column in it called &#8220;cohort&#8221;, and for each event for each user, that column needs to be populated with the results from the above query.</p>

<p>To take another example: say we want to bucket users again, but this time by the channel that drove them to our website in the first place. Again, to work this out, we need to look at the first event for each of those users, and see what drove him / her there. Our SQL query would look like:</p>
<div class='highlight'><pre><code class='mysql'><span class='k'>SELECT</span>
<span class='n'>e</span><span class='p'>.</span><span class='n'>user_id</span><span class='p'>,</span>
<span class='n'>mkt_source</span> <span class='k'>AS</span> <span class='n'>first_referer</span>
<span class='k'>FROM</span> <span class='n'>events_pbz</span> <span class='n'>e</span>
<span class='k'>INNER</span> <span class='k'>JOIN</span>
<span class='p'>(</span> 	<span class='k'>SELECT</span> 
	<span class='n'>user_id</span><span class='p'>,</span>
	<span class='nf'>min</span><span class='p'>(</span><span class='nf'>concat</span><span class='p'>(</span><span class='n'>dt</span><span class='p'>,</span><span class='s2'>&quot; &quot;</span><span class='p'>,</span><span class='n'>tm</span><span class='p'>)</span> <span class='p'>)</span> <span class='k'>as</span> <span class='n'>first_touch_timestamp</span>
	<span class='k'>FROM</span> <span class='ss'>`events_pbz`</span>
	<span class='k'>group</span> <span class='k'>by</span> <span class='n'>user_id</span> <span class='p'>)</span> <span class='n'>users</span>
<span class='k'>ON</span> <span class='n'>users</span><span class='p'>.</span><span class='n'>user_id</span> <span class='o'>=</span> <span class='n'>e</span><span class='p'>.</span><span class='n'>user_id</span>
<span class='k'>AND</span> <span class='nf'>CONCAT</span><span class='p'>(</span><span class='n'>e</span><span class='p'>.</span><span class='n'>dt</span><span class='p'>,</span> <span class='s2'>&quot; &quot;</span><span class='p'>,</span> <span class='n'>e</span><span class='p'>.</span><span class='n'>tm</span><span class='p'>)</span> <span class='o'>=</span> <span class='n'>first_touch_timestamp</span>
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>In our modified data set for our OLAP reporting tool, we&#8217;d want a column for this data (maybe called &#8220;first referrer&#8221;) that was populated with the <code>first_referer</code> field generated by the above query.</p>

<p>In both the above cases, we take data that we deduce about a dimension by scanning multiple rows of events data (in each case, about the &#8220;user&#8221; dimension), and add it into an additional column so that it is available on every row. This means that it is straightforward for the OLAP tool to identify events that should be aggregated together when slicing and dicing by that dimension, without having to scan multiple lines of data.</p>
<a name='practical'><h3>4. Some practical considerations related to star schemas and columnar databases</h3></a>
<p>OLAP has a long history (which means it is an old technology). In the literatue on OLAP, data structures are typically described in terms of star schemas: a denormalized data structure with a central &#8220;fact table&#8221; of the actual events that occured, linked to dimensions table (by lookups) that shed light on each individual action.</p>
<p style='text-align:center;'><img alt='pivot olap cube' src='/static/img/olap/star-schema.png' /></p><p style='font-size:small;text-align:right'>Image taken from <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_schema'>Wikipedia</a></p>
<p>Columar databases like Infobright mean organising data formally in a star schema is no longer necessary: we still store denormalized data, but effectively collapse all the dimension tables into the fact table, to create a single &#8220;fat&#8221; fact table with all the relevant dimensions:</p>
<p style='text-align:center;'><img alt='desired structure' src='/static/img/olap/desired-structure-for-olap.png' width='500' /></p>
<p>Columnar databases make this possible because they make &#8220;columns cheap&#8221;: query times are a function of the number of columns in the query - any that are unused are ignored. Having all the columns in a single table makes querying significantly easier: it means no joins are necessary. It also means tools like Tableau can run directly on our data table, without having to peform any joins themselves. (Which is generally a time consuming operation.)</p>
<a name='conversion'><h3>5. Converting SnowPlow event log data into dimensional OLAP structure: step by step guide</h3></a>
<p>Now that we know how we need to restructure SnowPlow data, we&#8217;re in a position to define the table that will house our OLAP data.</p>
