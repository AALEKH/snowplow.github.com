# Understanding SnowPlow data

The better you understand how your SnowPlow data is stored and structured, the easier it will be for you to query SnowPlow data. There are three elements to understand about SnowPlow data in particular:

1. [How SnowPlow data is produced] [production]
2. [Where SnowPlow data lives] [location]
3. [How SnowPlow data is structured] [structure]

*Note: this is just an overview geared towards data analysts. For a complete explanation of the SnowPlow technology stack including source code, visit the [wiki] [wiki] and [Github repository] [github-repo]*.

In a standard SnowPlow implementation, data is generated by the SnowPlow  tracking tags that are embedded on your website as part of the setup process. Every time an action is performed on your website (e.g. a user loads a page, plays a video, adds an item to basket etc.), the tracking tags performs a GET on the SnowPlow tracking pixel. Useful data related to the event (e.g. what action was performed, who the user is who performed it, what page they were on when they performed it etc.) is appended to the GET request.

The SnowPlow tracking pixel is served from [Amazon Cloudfront] [cloudfront]. A record of the GET request is recorded in the Cloudfront logs and these are stored in Amazon S3. Each line in the logs therefore represents a single user action.

Data analysis can be performed directly against the Amazon Cloudfront logs using [Hive][apachehive]. However, this is typically inefficient: in most cases the data is transformed in S3 into a format better suited for [Apache Hive] [apachehive], or transferred to [Infobright] [infobright] for analysis.
