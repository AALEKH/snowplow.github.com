# SnowPlow table structure

SnowPlow data is stored in a single Apache Hive table. Each line in the table represents a single event, be that a page view, add-to-basket, video play etc.

The table structures for SnowPlow data in Hive and Infobright are almost identical. We'll cover the structure of the [Hive table](#hive-table-definition) before looking at the [Infobright table definition](#infobright) to see how it differs.

## Hive table definitions

Understanding the SnowPlow table structure(s) in Hive is a pre-requisite to being able to write your own HiveQL queries.

The Hive table generated by **SnowPlowEventDeserializer** to hold SnowPlow-logged page views and events looks like this:

| **FIELD**            | **DATATYPE**   | **CAN BE EMPTY?** | **SINCE**  | **DESCRIPTION**            |
|:---------------------|:---------------|:------------------|:-----------|:---------------------------|
| **Date/time**        |                |                   |            | _The date and time of this page view or event_ |
| `dt`                 | STRING         | No                | -          | Date                       |
| `tm`                 | STRING         | No                | -          | Time                       |

| `txn_id`             | STRING         | No                | -          | A unique event ID. If two or more records have the same txn_id, one is a duplicate record |
| **User and visit**   |                |                   |            | _Identifying the web user and this specific visit_ |

| **Page**             |                |                   |            | _Identifying the web page being visited_ |

## Infobright table definitions

The Infobright table definition is very similar to the Hive table definition. Three differences are worth noting:

1. The data types for a number of fields are different. Hive is very good at casting e.g. STRINGs as FLOATs implicitly where possibly and explicitly where required at query time. Infobright is less good, so some of the fields that are set to STRING in Hive (e.g. ev_value) are set to numeric types in Infobright.
2. Infobright does not support the ARRAY data type used for the `br_features` field. Rather than pack all the different browser features in a single array, then, a separate column is used to store each possible browser feature.
3. We have not yet updated the Infobright table definition with the new fields introduced in the Hive deserializer 0.4.9 (see above for details)

The Infobright table looks like this:

| **FIELD**                | **DATATYPE**  |
