			<p>Snowplow's been a game-changer here at Viadeo. In a few months we were able to drop both Google Analytics and Omniture and now rely fully on Snowplow, in production, handling 10 million events per day. We like the versatility of the infrastructure - we use our internal Hadoop / Spark stacks to create deep BI reports, merging Snowplow data with other business data sets. We also love the simplicity and open-innovation approach provided by Redshift: today at Viadeo every single engineer and product manager is able to setup a rich metrics dashboard in a few minutes.</p>

			<p>We have been using Snowplow for the last 6 months to connect online user activity to transactional data (Quotes, Policites and Revenue). Reports have been built by our Business Intelligence team in our standard reporting framework (Microsoft SSAS Analysis Services), giving business users acess to data using their everyday reporting tools (Excel). Building these reports from the ground up using granular (Snowplow) data has allowed us to define the exact measures and dimensions that we need.</p>
			<p>The areas the data has been used to date are Product Performance Measurement and Marketing Optimisation. The marketing reports have given us granular insight we've never had before on campaign performance (to keyword level). From the output of the analysis we're saving substantial amounts of marketing spend that can be reallocated to other more profitable areas</p>

			<p>Having a web analytics platform with summarized data, like Google Analytics, can provide immense value to many orgnaizations, but the future of web analytics is not summarized data, it's large amounts of structured and highly granular enriched data that can provide even more value in the hands of the right team.</p>
			<p>Snowplow gives me complete ownership of my clickstream data with total flexibility at an affordable cost.</p>
