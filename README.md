This is the content for the SnowPlow Analytics website (http://snowplowanalytics.com). The content covers:

1. What SnowPlow is, including why we developed SnowPlow, and how SnowPlow differs from other approaches to web analytics
2. How SnowPlow works, from a technical standpoint
3. How we plan to develop SnowPlow
4. How to perform analyses using SnowPlow
5. Overview of the Professional Services we offer around SnowPlow

We welcome fixes and improvements! In particular on the analysis side, there are a wide range of ways SnowPlow can be used, and we can't possibly hope to cover them all ourselves. If you've used it for a specific type of analysis, we'd love you to share it here. Please fork the repo, make your changes and then create a pull request.
