# Data pipelines and algorithms

The last few years have seen the development of a new breed of ETL tools that enable the construction of sophisticated, fault tolerent, scalable data pipelines. We employ many of those tools in the Snowplow data pipeline, including software tools [Hadoop] [hadoop], [Hive] [hive] [Cascading] [cascading] and [Scalding] [scalding], and cloud computing based tools e.g. [Elastic Mapreduce] [emr] and [Amazon Redshift] [redshift]. 

We use that experience to assist clients develop and implement sophisticated data pipelines using these new technologies and cloud based services.
