# Data pipelines and analytics infrastructure

Want to leverage Amazon Web Services and big data technologies to help you get get value out of your company-specific data?

We have significant experience using Amazon Web Services including EMR, Redshift and Dynamo DB to build scalable, robust, fault tolerent data pipeline and data analytics infrastructure. We often use that experience to help clients implement custom data pipelines and analytic infrastructure to match their particular event models and data sets.

We are familiar not just with AWS, but a range of open source data processing technologies including  [Hadoop] [hadoop], [Hive] [hive] [Cascading] [cascading] and [Scalding] [scalding], and BI and analysis tools including [Tableau] [tableau], [ChartIO] [chartio] and [R] [r], all of which we can stitch together to deliver agile datawarehousing and reporting solutions for fast-movign, data-driven companies.
