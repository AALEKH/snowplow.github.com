# Analytics Projects

We help clients use their customer, catalogue and web analytics data to drive product development and marketing decisions.

## Context 

The profliferation of data (especially customer data) means there are more opportunities to use it to make the right product development and marketing decisions.

However, there are often barriers to using data to drive decision making:

* **Data infrastructure**. Few companies have gone through the expensive process of designing and implementing a customer-centric data warehouse, with all the  data transformations enable analysts to query across multiple data sets without programming expertise. Even in companies that have this infrstructure, web analytics data (and other digital data sources e.g. social media) typically lives outside of it
* **Technical skills shortage**. In the absense of a clean data warehouse that brings together all the relevant customer data sources, programming expertise is required to perform the necessary ETL and data crunching
* **Analytic skills shortage**. Even with the relevant technical expertise, significant analytic work is required to turn web analytics and other customer data into a meaningful picture of a customer-base, and then use that knowledge to inform decision making. That analytic process encompasses refining commercial decisions down to specific questions that can be tested with data, identifying the relevant data sources before designing and executing the analyses

## Our approach

1. Work with the client to **refine the business decision / question** into a subset of discrete questions that can be addressed in a data-driven way
2. In parallel with the above, **audit all available data sources**
3. **Design and execute the analysis**. Our experience in transforming and joining data sets and familiarity with a wide range of big-data ETL tools means we are able to do this quickly
4. **Pull the analyses together** into a coherent powerpoint deck that addresses the business question head on
5. **Present and iterate the findings with the client**, drawing on client knowledge of their customer-base not captured in the data to colour the analyses

## Project output

The primary output of any analytics project is a Powerpoint deck that directly addresses the business question posed, and weaves the different analyses performed into a coherent narrative in support of a specific recommendation for the client.

Some illustrateive analyses from past projects are shown below, to give a flavour of the analyses we produce:

## Examples of our work

### Example consumer analytics: engagement levels over time

[COMING SOON]

### Example catalogue analysis: conversion rate by product

The following graph was part of a catalogue analysis performed for an online retailer with a diverse set of more than 5000 SKUs across multiple categories.
