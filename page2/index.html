			<h1><a href="/blog/2013/04/23/performing-funnel-analysis-with-snowplow">Funnel analysis with Snowplow (Platform analytics part 1)</a></h1>
			<p><a href='/blog/2013/04/12/online-catalog-analytics-with-snowplow/'>Eleven days ago</a>, we started building out the <a href='/analytics/catalog-analytics/overview.html'>Catalog Analytics</a> section of the <a href='/analytics/index.html'>Analytics Cookbook</a>, with a set of recipes covering how to measure the performance of <a href='/analytics/catalog-analytics/measuring-and-comparing-content-page-performance.html'>content pages</a> and <a href='/analytics/catalog-analytics/measuring-and-comparing-product-page-performance.html'>product pages</a>.</p>

<p>Today we&#8217;ve published the first set of recipes in the new <a href='/analytics/platform-analytics/overview.html'>platform analytics</a> section of the Cookbook. By &#8216;platform analytics&#8217;, we mean analytics performed to answer questions about how your platform (or &#8216;website&#8217;, &#8216;application&#8217; or &#8216;product&#8217;) performs. This is one of the most important branches of analytics that can be performed with clickstream, event data.</p>

<p>The first recipes published cover how to perform <a href='/analytics/platform-analytics/funnel-analysis.html'>funnel analysis</a> with Snowplow, like the example below, that compares the purchase funnel for an online shop by month.</p>

<p><img alt='funnel-analysis' src='/static/img/analytics/platform-analytics/funnel-analysis/visualization-in-tableau.jpg' /></p>

<p>Funnel analysis is an important example of platform analytics. Snowplow makes it straightforward to define and analyse funnels on the fly: unlike Google Analytics, you do not have to predefine funnels in advance, then collect data, before you can analyse how users progress through them. This is important as it makes it possible to spot e.g. that your visitors are using your platform in a particular (perhaps unexpected) way, and then immediately drill into how many exactly, are doing so, and at what point in that workflow do different users &#8216;drop out&#8217; of the funnel.</p>

<p>In addition, Snowplow also makes it easy to compare multiple funnels (e.g. like the time series example above, or, instead, comparing how successfully different audience segments progress through different funnels).</p>

<p>This will be the first of many platform analytics recipes - if there are specific analyses you&#8217;d like us to cover, or would like to contribute yourself, then let us know below or by <a href='/about/index.html'>getting in touch</a> directly.</p>

			<p><em>This is the second part in our blog post series on Catalog Analytics. The <a href='/blog/2013/04/12/online-catalog-analytics-with-snowplow/'>first part</a> was published last week.</em></p>

<p>Last week, we started building out the <a href='/analytics/catalog-analytics/overview.html'>Catalog Analytics</a> section of the <a href='/analytics/index.html'>Analytics Cookbook</a>, with a section documenting how to <a href='/analytics/catalog-analytics/measuring-and-comparing-product-page-performance.html'>measure the effectiveness of your product pages</a>. Those recipes were geared specifically towards retailers.</p>

<p>This week, we&#8217;ve added an extra section to the cookbook, covering <a href='/analytics/catalog-analytics/measuring-and-comparing-content-page-performance.html'>how to measure engagement levels with content pages</a>. The recipes covered should be of interest to any company that produces content-rich web pages. (Indeed, all the example analytics were performed using data from this very website.) However, they should be of special interest to publishers and newspaper sites that depend on driving high levels of user engagement with content to make money</p>

<p>In the new section, we cover a range of recipes, including comparing web pages by what fraction of them is read, on average, by visitors to those pages:</p>

			<h1><a href="/blog/2013/04/12/snowplow-0.8.1-released-with-referer-url-parsing">Snowplow 0.8.1 released with referer URL parsing</a></h1>
			<p>Just nine days after our Snowplow 0.8.0 release, we are pleased to have our next release ready: Snowplow <strong>0.8.1</strong>. With the last release we promised that the new Scalding-based ETL/enrichment process would lay a strong technical foundation for our roadmap - and hopefully this release bears that out!</p>

<p>Until this release, Snowplow has provided users the raw referer URL, from which analysts can deduce who the referer was. In this release, Snowplow processes that referer URL to identify what drove a visitor to your website, specifically:</p>

<ol>
<li>Were they driven by a search engine, social network, or link in an email program?</li>

<li>If so, which search engine / social network / email program?</li>

<li>If they were driven by a search engine, what query did they enter?</li>
</ol>

<p>This data is key for performing attribution analytics.</p>

<p>Snowplow delivers the above functionality by parsing the page referer URIs which the JavaScript tracker sends to the collector. The Snowplow enrichment layer does a couple of things with these referer URIs:</p>

<ol>
<li>It splits the referer URL into its six components (scheme, host, port, path, query, fragment). This makes querying referer data significantly easier, as we hope to show in future blog posts and attribution analytics recipes</li>

<li>It looks up the referer URL in a database of known referers and attempts to extract details about this referer, which you can then use for marketing attribution. (For example - is the referer a search engine, or social network? What query did the user enter in the search engine?)</li>
</ol>

<p>We will publish a post on how to use the data in a blog post in the near-future. In the rest of this post, then, we will cover:</p>

		<a name="Snowplow event validation" />

			10 Apr 2013
			<h1><a href="/blog/2013/04/10/snowplow-event-validation">Towards high-fidelity web analytics - introducing Snowplow's innovative new event validation capabilities</a></h1>
			<p>A key goal of the Snowplow project is enabling <strong>high-fidelity analytics</strong> for businesses running Snowplow.</p>

<p>What do we mean by high-fidelity analytics? Simply put, high-fidelity analytics means Snowplow faithfully recording <em>all</em> customer events in a rich, granular, non-lossy and unopinionated way.</p>

<p>This data is incredibly valuable: it enables companies to better understand their customers and develop and tailor products and services to them. Ensuring that the data is high fidelity is essential to ensuring that any operational and strategic decision making that&#8217;s made on the basis of that data is sound. Guaranteeing data fidelity is not a sexy topic. But it&#8217;s an important one.</p>

<p>Surprisingly, ensuring your data is high fidelity is <strong>not</strong> something that is enforced by other analytics products.</p>

<p><img alt='high-fidelity' src='/static/img/blog/2013/04/high-fidelity-2000.jpg' /></p>

<p>Why is Snowplow so unusual in aiming for high-fidelity analytics? Most often, analytics vendors sacrifice the goal of high-fidelity data at the altar of these three compromises:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Premature aggregation</strong> - when the data store gets too large, or the reports take too long to generate, it&#8217;s tempting to perform the aggregation and roll-up of the raw event data earlier, sometimes even at the point of collection. Of course this offers a huge potential performance boost to the tool, but at the cost of a huge degree of customer data fidelity</li>

<li><strong>Ignoring bad news</strong> - the nature of event data means that often incomplete, corrupted or plain wrong data is sent in to the analytics tool by the event trackers. Handling bad event data is complicated (let&#8217;s go shopping!). Instead of dealing with the complexity, most analytics packages just throw the bad data away silently; this is why tag audit companies like <a href='http://www.observepoint.com/'>ObservePoint</a> exist</li>

<li><strong>Being over-opinionated</strong> - customer analytics is full of challenging questions which need answering before you can analyse the data: do I track users by their first-party cookie, third-party cookie, business ID and/or IP address? Do I use the server clock, or the user&#8217;s clock to log the event time? When does a user session start and end? Because these questions can be difficult to answer, most analytics tools don&#8217;t ask them: instead they take an opinionated view of the &#8220;right answer&#8221; and silently enforce that view through their event collection, storage and analysis. By the time users realize that the logic enforced is one that does not work for their business, they are already tied to that vendor and the imperfect data set they have created with that vendor to date.</li>
</ol>

<p>To deliver on the goal of high-fidelity analytics, then, we&#8217;re trying to steer Snowplow around these three common pitfalls as best we can.</p>

<p>We have talked in detail on our website and wiki about avoiding pitfall #1, Premature aggregation. In short: we do <strong>no</strong> aggregation - Snowplow users have access to granular, event level data, so that they can work out how best they should aggregate it for each type of analysis they wish to perform.</p>

<p>We will blog more about our ideas to combat #3, Being over-opinionated, in the future.</p>

<p>For the rest of this blog post, though, we will look at our solution to pitfall #2, Ignoring bad news: namely, <strong>event validation</strong>.</p>
