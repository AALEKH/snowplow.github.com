			<h1><a href="/blog/2012/12/17/transforming-snowplow-data-so-it-can-be-interrogated-by-olap-tools-like-tableau">Transforming SnowPlow data so that it can be interrogataed in BI / OLAP tools like Tableau, Qlikview and Pentaho</a></h1>
			<p>Because SnowPlow does not ship with any sort of user interface, we get many enquiries from current and prospective users who would like to interrogate SnowPlow data with popular BI tools like Tableau or Qlikview.</p>
<p style='text-align:center;'><img src='/static/img/olap/example-cube-2.png' width='250' alt='olap cube' /></p>
<p>Unfortunately, it is not possible to run a tool like Tableau directly on top of the SnowPlow events table. That is because these tools require the data to be in a particular format: one in which each line of data is made up of a combination of dimension and metrics fields, such that it is straightforward for the reporting tool to understand how to aggregate metrics by different combinations of dimensions. To give a very simple example of a data set that would play nicely with a reporting tool like Tableau:</p>
<table><thead><tr><th>Country</th><th>Date</th><th>Product</th><th>Number Sold</th><th>Revenue</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td style='text-align: left;'>UK</td><td style='text-align: left;'>Sept 2012</td><td style='text-align: left;'>Hats</td><td style='text-align: left;'>137</td><td style='text-align: right;'>1779.63</td>
</tr><tr><td style='text-align: left;'>UK</td><td style='text-align: left;'>Oct 2012</td><td style='text-align: left;'>Hats</td><td style='text-align: left;'>193</td><td style='text-align: right;'>2507.07</td>
</tr><tr><td style='text-align: left;'>UK</td><td style='text-align: left;'>Oct 2012</td><td style='text-align: left;'>Shoes</td><td style='text-align: left;'>15</td><td style='text-align: right;'>1125.00</td>
</tr><tr><td style='text-align: left;'>France</td><td style='text-align: left;'>Oct 2012</td><td style='text-align: left;'>Hats</td><td style='text-align: left;'>288</td><td style='text-align: right;'>2877.12</td>
</tr><tr><td style='text-align: left;'>&#8230;</td><td style='text-align: left;'>&#8230;</td><td style='text-align: left;'>&#8230;</td><td style='text-align: left;'>&#8230;</td><td style='text-align: right;'>&#8230;</td>
</tr></tbody></table>
<p>Reporting tools like Tableau recognise that the two right hand columns (number sold and revenue) are metrics, and that analysts will want to examine how those metrics vary by country, time and product (all of which are dimensions). They will give analysts easy-to-use tools to enable them to slice, dice, drill up and drill down those metrics by different combinations of those dimensions. Enabling those operations is straightforward for the reporting tool, because it knows it knows if the analyst wants to report product sales in the UK over time, to filter all results by country (so only lines of data from the UK are included), and display sales of each type of product by month.</p>

<p>This type of dimensional analysis is called <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_analytical_processing'>OLAP</a>, and has a long and venerable history in business intelligence. Although the term &#8216;OLAP&#8217; is no longer fashionable, this type of analysis is still the predominant one used by anyone who relies on PivotTables in Excel or any mainstream BI tool including Tableau, Qlikview, Microstrategy, Pentaho etc.</p>

			<h1><a href="/blog/2012/11/28/snowplow-0.6.2-released">SnowPlow 0.6.2 released, with JavaScript tracker bug fixes</a></h1>
			<p>Today we are releasing SnowPlow version <strong>0.6.2</strong> - a clean-up release after yesterday&#8217;s 0.6.1 release. This release bumps the JavaScript Tracker to version 0.8.1; the updated minified tracker is available as always here:</p>

<pre><code>http(s)://d1fc8wv8zag5ca.cloudfront.net/0.8.1/sp.js</code></pre>

<p>This release fixes two bugs:</p>

<ol>
<li><a href='https://github.com/snowplow/snowplow/pull/101'>Issue #101</a> - we had left in a <code>console.log()</code> in the production version, which should only have been printed in debug mode. Harmless but worth taking out. Many thanks to <a href='https://github.com/mtibben'>Michael Tibben</a> @ <a href='http://99designs.com'>99designs</a> for spotting this so quickly and fixing</li>

<li><a href='https://github.com/snowplow/snowplow/issues/102'>Issue #102</a> - there was a trailing space in our initialization code, <a href='https://github.com/snowplow/snowplow/blob/master/1-trackers/javascript-tracker/js/src/init.js'><code>init.js</code></a>, which could cause some issues in Internet Explorer. Many thanks to community member Alan Z for raising</li>
</ol>

<p>The JavaScript Tracker&#8217;s API and the Tracker Protocol are unchanged. We recommend upgrading to using the new JavaScript Tracker version 0.8.1 over the previous 0.8.0.</p>

<p>Finally, if you haven&#8217;t yet read our tutorial on <a href='https://github.com/snowplow/snowplow/wiki/Integrating-javascript-tags-with-Google-Tag-Manager'>Integrating the JavaScript Tracker with Google Tag Manager</a>, we would recommend taking a look - it makes these sorts of upgrades much easier.</p>

			<h1><a href="/blog/2012/11/27/snowplow-0.6.1-released">SnowPlow 0.6.1 released, with lots of small improvements</a></h1>
			<p>We&#8217;re happy to announce our next SnowPlow release - version <strong>0.6.1</strong>. This release includes updates:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Additional data collection</strong>. The Javascript tracker has been updated to capture additional data points, including a user fingerprint (which can be used as a <code>user_id</code> for companies tracking users across domains), the tracker version, browser timezone and color depth</li>

<li><strong>Javascript tracker updates</strong>. A number of updates have been made to make the Javascript tracker more robust</li>

<li><strong>Updates to the ETL flow</strong> so that the <code>user_agent</code> string and <code>platform</code> captured and stored in Hive / Infobright</li>

<li><strong>Improved EmrEtlRunner command line options</strong> now provide more flexibility when writing your data to storage</li>

<li><strong>Bug fixes</strong> related to loading SnowPlow data into Infobright</li>
</ol>

<p>Before we start - a big thanks to the community members who helped out on this release in a big way:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href='https://github.com/ramn'>Simon Andersson</a> @ <a href='http://www.qwaya.com'>Qwaya</a> substantially re-factored the JavaScript tracker, splitting it into multiple smaller files, which made our work significantly easier :-)</li>

<li><a href='https://github.com/moncaubeig'>Gilles Moncaubeig</a> @ <a href='http://en.overblog.com/'>OverBlog</a> contributed the user fingerprinting code - thanks Gilles!</li>

<li><a href='https://github.com/mtibben'>Michael Tibben</a> @ <a href='http://99designs.com'>99designs</a> continued his great work on EmrEtlRunner with improved command line options</li>

		<a name="Integrating SnowPlow with Google Tag Manager" />

			16 Nov 2012
			<h1><a href="/blog/2012/11/16/integrating-snowplow-with-google-tag-manager">Integrating SnowPlow with Google Tag Manager</a></h1>
			<p>A month and a half ago, Google launched <a href='http://www.google.com/tagmanager/'>Google Tag Manager</a> (GTM), a free tag management solution. That was a defining moment in tag management history as it will no doubt bring tag management, until now the preserve of big enterprises, into the mainstream.</p>

<p><img src='/static/img/gtm.JPG' alt='gtm' /></p>

<p>We have spent some time testing how to get SnowPlow tags working well with Google Tag Manager, and have documented our recommended approach to setting up SnowPlow with GTM on the <a href='https://github.com/snowplow/snowplow/wiki/Integrating%20javascript%20tags%20with%20Google%20Tag%20Manager#wiki-snowplow-setup'>wiki</a>.</p>

<p>In the course of reading the literature on tag management and Google Tag Manager in particular, we were struck by a number of issues and misconceptions:</p>

<ol>
<li>Setting up a Tag Management System is a big and complicated job. Much of the literature (especially around Google Tag Manager), and discussion (especially amongst members of the web analytics community) suggests it is very easy. Whilst Google Tag Manager is a straightforward product to use, the process of setting it up is difficult, because it involves thinking through, in a very rigorous way, exactly what data should be passed between the website and GTM. If this is not done properly, GTM will not have the relevant data to pass on to the tags it manages, including SnowPlow.</li>

<li>Exacerbating the above, there is a lack of detailed literature on how to go about identifying all the data points that should be passed between your website and tag management solution. Nearly all the guides to setting up GTM that we reviewed covered only the most basic of GTM setups, which is just enough to enable page tracking. Clearly, that is not going to be sufficient for anything but the simplest blogs and brochureware sites.</li>

<li>One of the tag management features most regularly trumpetted by digital and marketing analysts is that it frees them from having to liaise with their webmasters to add new tags and change existing tag setups. Even with a tag management solution in place, however, this may still be necessary if not all the data that the analyst wants passed through to their analytics package is available in the tag maangement system.</li>
</ol>

<p>As a step towards addressing the above issues, we have produced a step-by-step guide to both <a href='https://github.com/snowplow/snowplow/wiki/Integrating%20javascript%20tags%20with%20Google%20Tag%20Manager#wiki-setup-gtm'>setting up Google Tag Manager</a> and <a href='https://github.com/snowplow/snowplow/wiki/Integrating%20javascript%20tags%20with%20Google%20Tag%20Manager#wiki-snowplow-setup'>setting up SnowPlow within GTM</a>. We hope you find it useful. We plan to produce a similar guide to setting up SnowPlow within <a href='http://www.opentag.qubitproducts.com/'>Qubit&#8217;s OpenTag solution</a> in due course.</p>

<p>We&#8217;re very excited by Google&#8217;s launch of Tag Manager, and recommend all new SnowPlow users who are not currently using a tag management system integrate one as part of their SnowPlow setup. Specifically:</p>

<ol>
<li>The exercise that companies need to go through when setting up a tag management platform i.e. thinking through all the data points that they want to pass to their tag management system so that they can be passed on to whatever tags are managed in the system, is the same process they should go through when they setup SnowPlow, with a view to enabling the widest possible set of analyses on their web analytics data. So even though that exercise is not easy, it is valuable</li>

<li>The processing of mapping that data from the structure defined in the tag management system to one which works with SnowPlow&#8217;s data structure is the exact reverse of the analysis process that takes SnowPlow data and transforms it back into the structure that&#8217;s most natural for the company performing the analysis.</li>

<li>Once the tag management system has been installed, it becomes easy to upgrade the tags and / or change the configuration. There are a number of improvements we plan to make to our <a href='https://github.com/snowplow/snowplow/tree/master/1-trackers/javascript-tracker'>Javascript tracker</a>, and having a tag management program will make it easier for companies to take advantage of those upgrades.</li>
