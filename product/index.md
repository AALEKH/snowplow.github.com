# An overview of SnowPlow

## What is SnowPlow?

SnowPlow is a web analytics platform with a difference:

* You tag your website with javascript tags, just like any other web analytics product
* **All** your data (incl. individual customer-level and event-level data data) is stored on your own Amazon S3 account and / or Infobright database, where you can query it directly
* Because you have **all** your data on your own servers, you have the widest possible scope to perform whatever analysis you require with the data
