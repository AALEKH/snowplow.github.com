# Why SnowPlow?

We built SnowPlow because we were frustrated with the limitations of traditional web analytics programmes:

**Too narrowly focussed**

* Focus on marketing-related analytics (visits, click-throughs, conversions)
* Focus on e-commerce sites. (Limited number of goals limited related to clearly defined workflows e.g. *email signup*, *product purchase*)
* No analytics suitable for SaaS businesses, exploration of the drivers of customer value or platform analytics

**Inflexible**

* Hard to perform analyses spanning multiple customer visits
* Hard to examine the ways users actually **engage with the site**. (Vs counting page views, time on site)
* Hard to **map and segment users** based on their behaviour
* Limited tools to identify **root causes of differences in behaviour and outcome**

**Too high level and too low level**

* Impossible to zoom in on individual customers and events
* Impossible to see the wood for the trees, in a sea of pre-defined cuts of data that do not answer specific business questions

**Siloed**

* Hard to integrate data with other sources of customer data to build a **single-customer view**. (E.g. CRM, email marketing, social marketing, customer service, financial systems and ad serving systems)
* Typically **separated from** other **business intelligence** and analytics **systems**

#### Use SnowPlow to answer real business questions:

* Who are our most valuable customers?
* How can I spot them in advance?
* What are the *sliding doors* moments in a customer's journey that impact their future value?
* How does a customer base break down by behaviour?
* How well is each segment served? Is each segment monetized?
* What are the best opportunities to grow the value of my customer base? 

#### SnowPlow makes this possible by giving your direct access to your customer and event-level data

This gives you the ability to plugin the widest range of analytics tools to mine your web data and drive business value.
