# Traditional web analytics programs are very limited

### Too narrowly focussed 

* Focus on **marketing-related analytics** (visits, click-throughs, conversions)
* Focus on **e-commerce sites**. (Limited number of goals limited related to clearly defined workflows e.g. *email signup*, *product purchase*)
* No analytics suitable for **SaaS businesses**, exploration of the drivers of **customer value** or **platform analytics**

### Inflexible

* Hard to perform analyses spanning multiple customer visits
* Hard to examine the ways users actually **engage with the site**. (Vs counting page views, time on site)
* Hard to **map and segment users** based on their behaviour
* Limited tools to identify **root causes of differences in behaviour and outcome**

### Too high level **and** too low level

* Impossible to **zoom in on individual customers** and events
* Impossible to **see the wood for the trees**, in a sea of pre-defined cuts of data that do not answer specific business questions

### Siloed

* Hard to integrate data with other sources of customer data to build a **single-customer view**. (E.g. CRM, email marketing, social marketing, customer service, financial systems and ad serving systems)
* Typically **separated from** other **business intelligence** and analytics **systems**

## ...with terrible consequences for businesses

### Cannot use web analytics data to answer critical business questions

* Who are our most valuable customers?
* How can I spot them in advance?
* What are the *sliding doors* moments in a customer's journey that impact their future value?
* How does a customer base break down by behavoiur?
* How well is each segment served? Is each segment monetized?
* What are the best opportunities to grow the value of my customer base? 

### Cannot export data out of web analytics tools

* Some analytics tools (e.g. [Google Analytics] [google-analytics]) do not provide access to underlying  customer-level and event-level data
* Some web analytics tools (e.g. [MixPanel] [mixpanel]) do not give you access to **all** underlying data
* Some web analytics tools charge enormous sums of money to give clients their own data. (E.g. [Omniture] [omniture])

## Unfettered access to their own web analytics data

SnowPlow gives you complete freedom to
* use the widest range of tools to analyse your web analytics data
* perform the widest set of analyses, to answer the most important business questions related to your customers, websites and apps
